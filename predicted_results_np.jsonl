Your friends who work at a major motion picture studio have asked you to help improve their recommendation algorithm. Their current algorithm makes suggestions based on the similarity between user profiles using Euclidean distance. They would like to incorporate some machine learning techniques such as clustering algorithms and neural networks to enhance their existing recommendation engine.\n\nYou know from class that clustering methods try to group similar items together whereas neural network models aim to predict how likely an item might appeal to a particular user. Therefore they would like to combine these two approaches whereby clustering helps narrow down the set of possible recommendations and then a neural network model chooses one out of those clustered options.\n\nThe data they gave you contains both user profile descriptions and watched movie listings. Each user profile description consists of textual tags describing what kind of films interest him/her. For example, \u201cI love horror!\u201d and \u201cI hate romantic comedies\u201d could describe different users but they may still share common interests when it comes to recommending movies. Similarly, the movie listings consist of lists of movies rated by each user along with the date he/she last viewed them.\n\nTo begin, you decide to perform k-means clustering over user profile descriptions first before applying any machine learning models on the clusters created. However, after performing k-means clustering, you find that there are multiple ways of grouping the same set of users. This happens because of the inherent ambiguity in words such as \u201clike\u201d, \u201chate\u201d, etc. To address this problem, you apply word embedding techniques onto the textual tags extracted from the user profile descriptions before running k-means clustering. After doing this, the resulting clusters become much clearer. Next, you train a neural network model on the clusters and show the predictions back to your friend. He/She seems happy enough until you notice something strange\u2026\n\nOne of his coworkers named Bob claims that he hates science fiction yet he also loves Star Wars!

Movie Recommendation System using RATINGS Table\n\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDB database. The database contains two tables with the following columns:\n  \n    - tconst (string) : alphanumerical unique identifier of the title, eg, 'tt0000001'.\n    \n    - averageRating (float) : the average score out of five from all the reviews submitted by users for the particular title. For example, if there were ten reviews and they had scores ranging between one and five then the overall average would equal an integer value of 4.5 rounded downwards. Eg, If the first review scored a four, second review scored a three, third review scored a two, fourth review scored a five, fifth review scored a three, sixth review scored a four, seventh review scored a four, eight review scored a four, ninth review scored a five, lastly the tenth review scored a five. Then the average will be 4.5 because every time we add the total sum of all the numbers, divide them by how many times you added those numbers together. So if we have 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 3+ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 40 and divided by seven we get 4.5.\n     \n      - numVotes (int): the total number of votes cast for a title.\n      \n      \nYour task is to write a function named findMovieRecom() that takes in two parameters. One parameter is the string input provided by the user (either 'good' or 'bad') indicating what kind of content they want to watch next ('good' indicates they like happy films whereas 'bad' means sad ones). The second parameter is the list of the top 10 highest voted movies from the RATINGS table. This function returns a list containing the names of the top recommended movies to the user depending on whether they chose 'good' or 'bad.' Your function must also return a description of why these movies were chosen when the user chose either option.\n\nExample Output:\n```javascript\nfunction findMovies(){\n  var userInput=\"bad\"; //input\n  var movies= [\"The Shawshank Redemption\",\"Casablanca\"];"}

So I have tried my best to explain what we did stepwise so that you could learn while implementing this. This way you would be able to use these concepts later on for many other applications too.\n\n#### Step 1: Get Data From S3 Bucket ####\nFirstly you need to create s3 bucket where our training data will go. If you don't already have one then follow below steps to set them up:\n```shell script\naws configure --profile <your profile> # make sure you change this to correct profile otherwise you might face issues during deployment\naws sts assume-role \\\n--role-arn arn:aws:iam::<account id>:role/<your role> \\\n--session-name <your session name>\naws config update region us-east-2\necho \"export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access key>\" >> ~/.bash_profile\necho \"export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret access key>\" >> ~/.bash_profile\necho \"export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(curl https://$AWS_REGION.$AWS_DEFAULT_DOMAIN/$AWS_STS_URI | jq.Credentials.SessionToken)\" >> ~/.bash_profile\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\nOnce done logout and login again into aws console and check whether your credentials are saved properly.\nNext thing you need to do is to download your training data file from s3 bucket. For this purpose I created a simple python program called `get_data.py` which takes two parameters:\n* **bucket**: name of the bucket containing training files\n* **path**: path inside the bucket where you want to retrieve data\n\nTo run above command simply execute `./get_data.py <bucket name> <path>` from terminal. After running this command successfully, open terminal once again and write below commands to see data retrieved from s3 bucket:\n```python\nfor f in os.listdir('/tmp/'):"}

It would look something similar to what you saw earlier but here we have added additional details. These details represent additional criteria that may affect how a movie gets selected as a recommendation.\n\nInput | Output\n---|---\nMy favourite genre is Horror. I want a good scare!! | \tRecommendation: Hostel  (2011), Score: 7\nMy favourite actor is Robert Englund. | Recommendation: Freddy vs Jason  (2003), Score: 8\nMy favourite actresses are Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox Arquette. | Recommendation: Scream  (1996), Score: 9\n\nThis time there were multiple factors taken into account when selecting a candidate for recommendation. This means you cannot simply select the highest scoring movie using just the average rating because that could potentially mean the worst rated movie overall might still get chosen due to other considerations. Therefore, you must create a method that returns both the best possible score AND the corresponding recommended movie. For example, even though the best scored movie according to average rating alone is The Shining  (1980), this movie does not match all requirements of our client and therefore cannot be recommended.\n\nNote: You do NOT need to worry about the implementation right now, however, you MUST explain HOW your solution works and WHAT decisions your code makes during execution."}

This means we select any movie that isn't an episode or video game and doesn't have an unspecified genre. We order these by duration so they aren't necessarily all short films since some may just have low durations because they were made quickly. The second part then selects every movie rated over one time. Since there could be multiple ratings per movie we want to make sure there are enough ratings before selecting them. Finally, we group those together into a single row by sorting alphabetically and using `limit`.\n\nThen comes another union all. Firstly, we join the `title_principal` table onto itself twice once to find out who stars in what role and again to see who wrote what. Afterwards, we perform two additional joins to get the cast members and creators behind the scenes. Lastly, we use yet another union to gather all the details regarding how many times each movie was recommended to us and how many users voted on its rating."}

This way the algorithm takes into account not just how similar the actor profiles are but also how likely they were seen acting together before.\nBecause we don't know exactly when an actor appeared in what role, there might still exist cases where one actor appears twice because he had different roles in two separate movies. To avoid those scenarios we check if the two actors appear in the same movie before returning the final list of candidates. If so then we remove them from our candidate pool.\n\nIn order to make sure that no duplicate entries get returned we store the last seen timestamp for every entry in our candidate set. Whenever we add a new entry we compare its time against already existing ones and return only those who haven't been recommended yet.\"\"\""}

Generic Data Warehouse\n\nYou are building a data warehouse to store information about products sold across multiple stores over time. Each product may be available in different stores but never simultaneously in two different stores. Some products will also become unavailable during some period of time. For example, the following data exists for Product 1:\n* Available in Store X between Jan 2015 and Jun 2015\n* Not currently available anywhere\n* Was previously available in Store Z until Oct 2014\n\nCreate an EAV schema for storing these facts using the following attributes:\n```sql\nid (int not null constraint pk, auto increment)\nstore (varchar(2))\nstartDate (date)\nendDate (date)\nproductCode (varchar(10), constraint uq, index)\n```\n\nThe first attribute `id` would serve as the primary key, however, you don't want any values repeated so you add a UNIQUE CONSTRAINT to ensure no duplicates exist. The second attribute `store` allows us to specify whether the fact applies to a particular store, while the third and fourth allow us to track when we were able to purchase the item, and what code the item had at that moment. We use `constraint uq`, because we know there could potentially be duplicate codes, but they shouldn't overlap.\n\nWrite a SELECT statement that returns one row per day for every month between May 2014 and July 2015 inclusive, and group them together into months. This means the final result set should look like something similar to the image below.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GJbvQOE.png)\nNote that you do NOT need to create indexes here. Instead, show how you would write the queries needed to perform this functionality.\n\n**Hint #1:** Use an INNER JOIN instead of LEFT OUTER JOINS to avoid returning NULL values. If possible, try to eliminate subqueries altogether.\n\n**Hint #2:** Think carefully before selecting columns - consider creating computed columns.\n\n**Hint #3:** Be careful of GROUP BY clauses - make sure you understand why you"}

This time we will use an API endpoint provided by one of our partner sites. For example, Amazon\u2019s API allows access to its product catalogue so you could get book recommendations via its search APIs. Another interesting thing here is that some products might not exist anymore but they still appear in the catalog because those products were once sold there before being discontinued. So when building your application make sure you handle these kinds of situations gracefully since no matter what happens everything needs to work properly even though sometimes things go wrong unexpectedly due to unforeseen circumstances beyond anyone control including yours!\n\nSo far every time someone asked me \u201cWhat kinda stuff did u learn?\u201d My response always started off with either Java OR C++ BUT THIS TIME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT!!! Now instead saying JAVA OR C++, I am going tell them exactly WHAT I LEARNED!! Because I learned SO MUCH STUFF while working through this project!!\n\n### Part Three\nIn part two we saw how easy it really isn't just writing code inside IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). Instead developers usually spend hours upon weeks designing mockups before ever getting down into actual implementation details themselves thus resulting in poor quality solutions created under pressure leaving little room left over afterwards meaning less time spent debugging later which leads directly back towards design problems again...so why bother trying anything new? Well hopefully after reading this post along side my previous posts then maybe next week i'll give another shot myself ;)"}
