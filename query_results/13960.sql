SELECT statement as described in the textbook. Make sure that all table names are spelled correctly.
•	Include aliases when necessary. Use proper JOIN syntax between related tables.
•	Make sure that you include the column headings from each table being joined together. For example, if there were three different movies listed then you would list them under the appropriate heading so that they could be grouped into categories like "Comedy", "Action" etc... If multiple values exist within one row make sure to separate those using commas instead of spaces e.g., "Alien","Star Wars". Also remember not every field needs its own alias
