Create an index in MySQL\nIn order to improve performance when retrieving data from your databases you may want to create indexes. Indexes are used by the Database Management System (DBMS) to speed up certain types of queries against the underlying table structure. For example if we wanted to retrieve all rows containing the word \"Science\" then using an index allows us to quickly find those rows instead of having to scan every row in our table one-by-one which could take time depending upon how many records there are within each column being searched through. In addition indexing also helps reduce disk IO operations since most searches will return fewer than ten items per page so less pages means less reads/writes onto disks thus reducing wear & tear over long periods due increased usage patterns such as reading large amounts at once multiple times throughout day etc..\n\nThis section describes creating an index in MYSQL along side some examples demonstrating what happens behind scenes during creation process itself while performing different tasks like selecting specific fields out from various columns present inside given dataset via SELECT statements followed by updating values contained within same table after making necessary changes made previously mentioned above steps taken care off first part before moving forward towards next step called inserting new entries into existing set already created earlier priorly discussed herein just now finished writing down few lines ago here right now currently typing these words exactly nowhere else except maybe somewhere nearby close proximity area around us but probably not really sure about exact location actually don\u2019t even know myself yet still trying figure out where exactly located presently talking about currently speaking about current situation right here standing outside my house looking back toward front doorway entrance leading straight ahead past living room kitchen dining hall bathroom bedrooms closets storage areas attic basement garage shed garden patio porch balcony deck stairs elevator escalators ramp curbs ramps driveways walkways paths bridges roads highways freeways interstates express ways turnpike toll booths traffic signals stop lights pedestrian crosswalks bus stops subway stations train tracks airports hangars runways taxi cabs limousines shuttle busses", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

We'll also look at how to pass data between components as well as conditionally render content. This is an essential skill in React!\n\n## Instructions\n- In `app.js`, we want to make changes so that when the user clicks the button, they are redirected to another page which contains all the information about each film within our JSON file. To do this, create a new function called `handleClick` inside of `<App />`.\n```javascript\nfunction handleClick() {\n    window.location = \"/moviedb\" // <-- Change here\n}\n```\n- Now we have a way of navigating to `/moviedb`, but what if we wanted to change some text beforehand? For example, maybe instead of saying \"Welcome!\" we would like to say something more personalized, such as \"Hello John Smith\", etc... If we were able to access the current state by doing something similar to this: ```state => console.log(JSON.stringify(state));```, then we could use that value however we liked. However, since there isn't currently any method available through react for accessing global variables/functions outside of its scope (like `window`), let alone one that returns anything useful besides just `undefined`, then we must find other ways around this problem - namely by creating custom hooks ourselves! So first thing I did was create my very own hook named `usePersonalizeText()` which takes two parameters: **`name`:** A string representing whatever name goes into place whenever someone types out \"Welcome\" followed by `[first name]` OR `[last name]`. And **`data`:** An object containing either `\"first\"` or `\"last\"` depending upon whether they typed those words themselves respectively. Once done setting up these two things appropriately enough according to how much room needs clearing off left sidebar menu bar itself after clicking said button above once again; now comes time getting actual functionality working correctly too!!\n```react jsx\nimport React, { Component } from'react';\n// import MovieSearchBar from './MovieSearchBar';\nimport Movielist from './Movielist';\n\nclass App extends Component{\n\tconstructor(){\n\t\tsuper();\n\t\tthis.state={\n\t\t\tmovies:[", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

For example, if we take Rear Window again, then its overall score would be 7 out of 10 while individual scores could range between 6/10 and 9/10.

You do not need to rank these movies since there may exist multiple equally-rated movies. In addition, please note that the total number of items returned may exceed 10 because some movies might receive fewer than 10 votes so those ones won\u2019t appear in your final list. Also remember that you don\u2019t necessarily want every possible combination being generated!

This means implementing the query generation part of the algorithm as well as training the model so that when new movies are added to the database they will automatically get recommended to people who have watched them before.\nThe first thing to do is write an implementation of your SQL query from Part I which returns all matching films given some user preference inputs. For example if someone searches for \"thrillers\" then this query would return a list of matching titles along with each film's rating score out of five stars. If there aren't any matches found then just return null instead since no one wants empty lists returned back anyway right? Next step involves training up our machine learning models by feeding data into these algorithms until they learn how best match similar items together based off past interactions between different individuals within our dataset itself though typically speaking those numbers tend towards being fairly low overall unless perhaps during peak holiday periods where everyone seems interested at once somehow...\n\nIn order to train your model, you must gather enough data points about both positive and negative feedback received from viewers regarding certain movies. This information could include ratings given on sites like IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes; comments made online after watching said flick(s); etc.. Once collected, use logistic regression techniques such as SVM classifiers (Support Vector Machines), KNN methods & Neural Network architectures among others depending upon what type/classification problem needs solving here. Then apply whatever appropriate technique suits yer fancy most effectively while keeping things simple yet effective simultaneously. Finally pass these predictions through another layer called \u201cpost-processing\u201d wherein additional filters remove irrelevant noise thereby reducing computational costs significantly thus improving performance metrics greatly over time!\n\nTo build a recommender system, you\u2019ll need to create a training set consisting of examples of previous customer behavior. This might look something like this:\n\n| Movie Title | User ID | Rating Score | Customer Feedback Comments |\n|--------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| A Quiet Place  | UID007   | 4                    | It was great!         |\n| The Dark Knight | UID006   | 3                     | Not my cup o tea      |\n| Black Panther  | UID005  |", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

In this second part, we want to optimize our query further so that we can produce more accurate recommendations while still keeping things simple enough to maintain performance at scale. For example, imagine there were thousands of movies being queried each day instead just three! To accomplish these goals let's consider two additional optimization strategies:\n* Use JOIN operations between multiple table joins rather than nested WHERE clauses within those join statements themselves\n* Create indexes over important fields like `genre` or even better combine them into compound indices containing both the genre column plus any other relevant information about specific movies e.g., year released etc...\n\n### Bonus Task #1 - Improved Performance\nNow that we know how to improve accuracy through JOINing tables together along with creating index-based optimizations around key data points lets put everything together into one big fat query statement!

Your program must take two inputs: the first being a list of movies already watched by a user along with ratings associated with each film, and secondly the movie that needs to be recommended. For every pairwise comparison between these two lists, we want our application to return the similarity score so that similar films are grouped together and dissimilar ones kept apart.\n\nTo accomplish this objective, you have access to all the data available at IMDB website which contains information about more than 1 million movies released worldwide since 1900's till today! It also provides details like actors/actresses involved in making those movies etc., but unfortunately no rating column exists anywhere inside any table within their database schema; however luckily there does exist another field called \"genre\" where each entry has been assigned either true value if belongs under genre category otherwise false otherwise! This means even though we don't know how many times people rated something positively nor negatively still somehow knowing whether person liked watching certain type over others helps us get closer towards solving problem stated above because now instead having just one variable representing preference level towards particular thing now multiple variables exist thus giving better picture overall hence improving accuracy significantly compared before when everything relied solely upon single factor alone i.e., number itself without considering anything else around them!\n\nHere is what I mean exactly:- Suppose someone likes horror movies then obviously they won\u2019t enjoy romantic com", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

What are the advantages of using SQL over other programming languages such as Python when building applications from scratch in terms of efficiency and scalability?\n\n#### Answer : \n* Efficiency \u2013 SQL queries execute faster than code written by programmers because they\u2019ve been optimized for speed since the beginning. It also doesn\u2019t require compilation like Java does before execution which means there aren\u2019t many opportunities for errors during development time! This makes them ideal if your application needs realtime updates due its fast response times compared with other technologies available today e.g., PHP scripts running through Apache servers etc.. Scalable \u2013 A good way to think about how well an app scales would be how much data gets processed per second under different loads while maintaining performance levels throughout these periods too so we know what kinda workload our apps will handle properly at peak hours where demand increases significantly beyond normal usage patterns (*cough*, Black Friday).\n\n#### Question 2 : \n> 2. Which one of the following statements best describes the difference between a relational model and a nonrelational model?\n\n#### Answer : \n* Relation models have relations between objects whereas Nonrelation Models do not. For example, a relation model could look something like this: Person (firstname, lastname) <br /> Company (name, address)<br /> Employee (employeeID number) & Employee has", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

So please write clearly written sentences explaining precisely what kinda thingy u wanna make happen first time round ;)\n\nThis part explains why we need aggregation functions. In order to get accurate answers regarding popularity levels amongst viewers across various titles shown through platform,we need collect certain amount relevant statistics based upon specific criteria set forth previously mentioned sections above. By using appropriate techniques available online e.g., MySQL SELECT statement combined w/ GROUP BY clause & HAVING clause respectively - we shall achieve desired goal easily while avoiding unnecessary complications arising due improper implementation process itself!!\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nThe solution approach involves creating a stored procedure that takes two parameters \u2013 userID and filmId \u2013 and returns the total number of votes casted for each movie by that particular user ID.

You may use any libraries you want but make sure not to use numpy. Your code must include the following features/functionality:\n\n1. Functionalities such as user input, user preference history, and SQL queries\n    - User input should allow users to enter new information about themselves so they can update their profile by adding more recent films watched.\n    - Users will also have access to the option to delete one item from their list at a time if desired after reviewing all items in their preference history. This means there could potentially exist duplicate entries within each row due to deletions being made later than additions were first recorded; however these duplicates would still count towards overall number of movies seen per person because both types represent different points along timeline where someone might've added something else onto his/her watchlist before deleting anything off earlier version(s).\n   - In order to determine whether two people share similar tastes (based upon how many times certain titles appear together), we calculate \"cosine similarity\" between pairs of lists containing all available ratings given across multiple individuals who rated those same works separately over time period spanning years!\n    \n2. A function called getRecommendedMovies() which takes in user input and returns recommended movies according to the specified criteria.\n\n3. An interactive web app built on Flask that allows users to create profiles and submit them through forms. Each form includes fields for entering personal details such as age range (e.g., teens vs adults), gender identity etc...

If no match found then creates new entry otherwise updates existing record accordingly depending on what type was selected during registration process i.e.: if male chose female then update field value accordingly vice versa etc..

Movie Recommendation System - Part II ###\n\n#### Challenge Description ####\n\nGenerate an SQL query that will return a list of movies from the IMDb database by using the user's preference history as well as other criteria such as popularity rating. Your solution must include all parts of the challenge description in order to receive full credit. Specifically your code must do ALL of these things below. **Note**: The solution MUST run properly when you submit it so make sure to test before submitting! If any part of the program does not work correctly then you may lose points even if everything else works.\n\nYou have been given access to data about different types of movies stored within the IMDB database. For each type of movie there are several attributes including title, year released, genre, cast members etc... Each row represents one specific instance of that particular type of film. In addition we also know how much people liked those films via ratings. We want to find some way to use this information to predict whether someone would like another movie which they haven't seen yet. To accomplish this goal our algorithm needs two pieces of additional information: firstly what kinds of things did they already enjoy watching? Secondly who was involved in making them both? These questions cannot simply be answered directly because there isn't enough time during development phases nor sufficient computing power available at present; however luckily modern machine learning techniques allow us solve these problems fairly easily through simple calculations involving probabilities calculated over large amounts of training examples gathered previously during production runs where similar tasks were performed successfully.\n\nTherefore suppose I ask my friend \"What kinda stuff d'you like?\" He might respond something along lines :\"Well i really dig horror flicks but sometimes action adventures too\". So now let me tell him that I've got just perfect suggestion which fits his taste perfectly! That would mean having knowledge about both likes/dislikes & interests (in case he watched some TV series). But wait...there could still exist some unknown factors affecting outcome here..maybe some random events happened somewhere far away causing certain changes leading up towards final conclusion regarding movie selection process itself....so lets try adding more variables into mix until eventually reaching point where probability becomes very close indeed :)\n\n### 8.

Your website must support at least three different types of products which are categorised as follows;\n1. Books [ISBN Number, Title, Author Name, Publisher Name, Publication Year].\n2. Clothes [Size, Colour, Brand, Price Per Item, Quantity in Stock].\n3. Toys [Brand, Type, Price per Unit, Number of Units In Stock].\nYou will also require a table that contains customer details including email address, phone number and delivery postcode. Whenever a user places an order they have two options, either collect from store location or receive by courier service. If they select courier then you will create another table called `Couriers` containing information about each individual courier company such as their name, cost per item, minimum/maximum weight limit and time taken between collection point and delivery destination.\n\n### Example 7 - Hotel Booking System\nDesign a hotel booking application that uses MySQL as its backend. This app needs to allow visitors to search hotels within specific locations according to various criteria such as star rating, price range etc., and make reservations accordingly. It would also need some sort of payment gateway integration so that when people check out after their stay there\u2019d be no problem making payments via credit card or other means if required. Finally include features like notifications sent out whenever someone makes changes regarding their existing reservation(s).\n\n### Example 8 - Car Rental Database\nThis project involves designing a car rental database that includes all necessary fields for storing data related to cars available for rent along with their respective prices and terms & conditions applicable upon usage. Users may view these items through searching or browsing functions provided by our web interface while admin panel provides access control over what kind of privileges each member has across entire site content.\n\n### Example 9 - Library Management System\nA library management system allows patrons to borrow books from libraries worldwide.

The app needs to accept new entries from the user of additional favorite movies as well as add them to the list of previous entries.

For example, if there are ten movies in total, then the recommendation algorithm would compare every possible pair-wise combination between these movies. As we increase the number of movies in our dataset, this operation becomes more time consuming since the number of comparisons increases exponentially. Therefore, we want to store fewer movies in order to avoid wasting too much CPU resources during computation. However, storing less data than what might actually be useful could lead us into making poor choices about which films deserve inclusion within our collection.

Recommendation System - Part Two\n\n[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/recommender-system/)\n\nGiven an array of items and a user's ratings of each item in the form of nonnegative integers. Find all pairs of distinct items whose sum is equal to the given target number T. Note that you may return multiple pairs of items if there exists more than one pair such that both sums of the two corresponding sets of items equals T. If no valid set exists, then return [-1,-1]. Example: Given A=[1,2,3], B=[4,5,6], C=[7,8,9] and the target value is 12, find all possible pairs of values that will give us the total score of 12 when we add up these numbers. So here we have three arrays but we want to compare them against another set which has been defined as a constant variable \"target\".\n\nInput Format : An integer array representing the items. Another integer array representing the scores of those items by the user. And lastly, an int T denoting the desired target score. Output Format : All possible combinations of two elements from different lists so long they meet the condition of being added together to get exactly the same number as the target. Sample I/O : [[1],[2]], [[3]] Target Value=1 Expected Answer:[(1,1),(2,1)] Sample II/O : [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] Target Value=12 Expected Answer:([(1,4), (2,5)), (3,6), (7,8), (9,9)] Sample III/O : [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8,9]] Target Value=11 Expected Answer:([(1,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,8)])\n\n### 177.

Your GCP project ID will not change throughout all tasks of the assignment so you do not have to re-create the project every time. Note down your project ID somewhere safe as you will use it later.\n\nThe schema of the destination table should match closely with the source table but not exactly since we are adding extra fields here such as the user preference history field which does not exist in the source table. To achieve this, create two new files called `schema_movie_recommendation.sql` and `load_movies_from_imdb.sql`. Both these scripts should live inside `/hdfs/user/studentid/` directory where studentID is replaced by yours. For example if I was student number **8** then my hdfs path would look like this: ```/hdfs/user/8```\n\nYou must run both scripts before moving onto the next step otherwise there may be problems when trying to execute the second script. This is because the first script creates temporary tables while the second one tries to read them. If they don't exist yet then there won't be any data available to read. Run each file separately after updating the path variable at the top.\n\nAfter creating the required schema, move over to `load_movies_from_imdb.sql` and write the actual code needed to populate the target table. This should consist mainly of the DML commands necessary to copy rows between different databases. There is also some additional logic required to handle null values coming back from the source database. In particular, there needs to be handling around how null values get passed through during joins. See below for more details about this topic.\n\n#### Null Handling ####\nIn our case we are copying records across multiple databases. Because of this, it means that sometimes the value returned from the previous database might contain NULL values instead of the expected data type. Whenever a row gets copied over with a NULL value, what happens behind the scenes depends on whether the column has been declared as NOT NULL or NOTNULL in the CREATE TABLE statement.\n\nIf the column had been declared as NOT NULL then the NULL value causes an error to occur due to violation of constraint.

For example, if I enter \"action\" into the input box then my script would make a query to get all rows where genre contains any row containing the word \"Action\". Then the script should take those returned values and order them by popularity first and then alphabetically.\n\nMySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html\nPHP: http://php.net/manual/en/function.usort.php\n\n### Question #8 - Construct a Data Dictionary for the Movie Recommender System ###\n\nOnce we have our database schema defined along with some logic implemented within our PHP script, we now need to construct what is called a \u201cData dictionary\u201d. A data dictionary provides us with information such as field names, types, constraints etc., which allows us to define how data is stored within each column so that applications can read it properly when reading back out again later down stream during processing time frames once processed through various business rules before being sent off for further analysis via analytical tools.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s also another important piece here \u2013 metadata!

Each row represents one user who rated different films during a particular time period. For each film rating, include the ID number of both the film and the user who gave the review; also include the date when the review was given.\n\nIn your ETL process, consider the following steps:\n* Convert the ratings into binary values by assigning 1 if they are above 3 stars otherwise assign zero. This way we can calculate similarities among reviews and filter out spammy users.\n* Calculate the similarity score of every pair of users, which can then be used to compute the similarity matrix.\n* Filter out irrelevant rows such as those where either the user has no other reviewed movies apart from the ones already included in the dataset or the same movie is being recommended multiple times.\n* Compute the average similarity of all pairs of users and store it in a new column called \u2018similarity\u2019.\n* Create a new column named \u2018totalSimilarity\u2019 containing the sum of the scores calculated earlier.\n* Find the top K most similar users (K = 20).

Reasoning: User knows one of the most popular mystery films in history and has shown an interest towards dark mysterious thrillers like The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo which was also a mystery film. It makes sense that he would enjoy other similar mystery films such as Seven since they both have dark themes and great acting performances by well-known actors.\nRecommendation #2 - Fargo (1996). Reasoning: Both these movies are rated highly by critics and showcase crime dramas set in snowy locations where the main character is a police officer who investigates murders. Since user liked the setting of Se7en we think it's likely they will appreciate another movie set in the same location but with different plot lines.\n\n### Part C \u2013 Implementing Models\nImplementation Instructions:\nIn this part of your project, implement the models from Part B into your application using Python\u2019s built-in machine learning libraries NumPy & Scikit Learn. This section requires some coding knowledge so if you don\u2019t feel comfortable implementing ML models then skip ahead to Part D below. If not sure what steps to take next refer back over previous sections for guidance!\n\n#### Data Preprocessing Steps:\nCreate new variables called \"user_id\", \"genre\" and \"year\". For each genre column create two separate categories for the data: \"action/adventure\" vs everything else. Then add additional columns named \"user_rating_mean\", \"user_rating_stddev\" and \"num_voters\" for each row in all tables except title_basics table. In addition, rename \"isAdult\" field in title_basics table to \"ageRestriction\".\n\n#### Model Training Steps:\n1. Import scikit learn library\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import svm\n```\n2. Create SVM model object\n```python\nsvc = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')\n```\n3. Train model on training dataset\n```python\nX_train = X[np.logical_and(X[:,'movie_title'].notnull(), X[:,'movie_genre'].notnull())].values()\nY_train = Y[np.logical_and(X[:", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

This project will consist of three parts:\n\nPart A \u2013 Entity-Relation Diagram (ERD)\n\nPart B \u2013 ER Diagrams\n\nPart C \u2013 Relational Database Design\n\nThis part requires the implementation of the relational design using MySQL Workbench. To complete this assignment successfully, please read all instructions carefully before beginning work.\n\n#### Instructions\n\nThe first step toward building any successful product is understanding how customers use it. In order to understand customer usage patterns, Netflix needs to collect information from them about what they are watching now and what they want to watch next. This information comes primarily through two sources:\n\n1. Customer\u2019s view history: What titles did the user previously select? When was each selection made? How long were these selections viewed? Were there other factors involved such as when was each item selected, where did the user search for it, etc.?\n2. User profile: Age, gender, interests, location, relationship status, occupation, income level, education level, home ownership, marital status, religion, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, political affiliation, height, weight, body type, hair color, eye color, skin tone, piercings & tattoos, musical taste, food preference, TV shows watched, books read, sports teams followed\u2026 basically everything else!\n\nNetflix wants to store both pieces of information together so that it knows not just which movies people liked but also why those choices might make sense given who they are as individuals\u2014and vice versa. Therefore we'll create two separate tables called \u201cviewHistory\u201d and \u201cuserProfile\u201d. Each table contains four fields: id (primary key), timestamp (date time stamp), titleID (foreign key referencing another table), and value(text). Note: If possible try avoiding foreign keys because they tend slow down queries significantly due too much overhead being spent determining whether something belongs somewhere else instead focusing solely on retrieving actual content itself; however sometimes necessary depending upon circumstances surrounding particular situation at hand during development process.

Provide examples if possible. Explain what measures are needed to prevent such attacks?\n\nTo execute any command against a SQL server we must first create a valid username/password combination then inject our commands into the user supplied parameter value. An example would be like the one below:\n```sql\n--Create User\nCREATE USER 'John' IDENTIFIED BY '<your password here>'\nGO\n```\nNow when John executes his queries he will have access to everything in the database including all passwords.\nAs far as prevention goes there are many ways but the most basic method is to always check every incoming request and sanitize them before sending them off to the database.

Do not write any table names. If there was more than one column from a specific table then separate them by commas. For example if you had two columns 'title_type','startyear', 'runtimeminutes'. Then they will go into the list separated by comma so the list looks something like ('title_type','startyear','runtimeminutes'). Note here that we have used an underscore '_' instead of space between words which makes our code look cleaner when we copy paste it later. So make sure you use _ underline whenever possible. Also note here that we wrote down titles first before numbers because the names come after tconst while numbers comes after nconst. It might seem confusing at first but once you see how it works it becomes easy.\n\nStep 2: Now let us take a closer look at the data types of these fields. In other words, find out what kind of values does each field store? This is important since most people get stuck here. Let me give you a hint about what to search online for - \"data type\" + the name of the programming language/platform you want to learn such as \"php data type\", \"java data type\". That way you don't waste time looking up stuff that doesn't apply to you.\n\nSo now lets say for instance you were working on php platform then you could simply google things like \"php date data type\" etc.. And similar thing goes for python where you just put \"python data type\" followed by whatever field name you wish to know its datatype.\n\nOnce you figure out the datatypes of all these fields then proceed to Step #3 below...\n\nStep 3: Finally we can move onto writing our actual sql statement itself! Remember earlier when i said that sometimes people forget certain steps during learning process due to lacking proper guidance? Well thats exactly why im telling you guys ahead of time right away!! Here again though remember that even though there may be multiple rows within each table yet those rows themselves represent individual records stored inside databases.

Now you must implement an application that allows users to enter information about themselves as well as retrieve the recommended list of films from the database using your generated SQL query. In addition, each film returned by the query needs to include its cover image and trailer URL.\n\nThe recommended list will contain at least ten movies per request so the maximum number of movies retrieved by one call should not exceed 100 movies. If more than 100 movies are found then all those movies should still be included in the response but they should also include an indication of how many were received and what page number was reached when trying to display them all. For example if there were exactly 100 movies available then the total would return \"Total = 100\" otherwise \"Total > 100\". Please note that the recommended list could potentially span multiple pages due to the size limitations mentioned above.\n\nTo make things easier we've provided two files called `app.js` & `movieReq.js`. These scripts allow us to use a simple API call within our website where the parameters used correspond directly to data entered into forms within your web app. All code written inside these functions/scripts should be contained within the file itself rather than being placed outside of it somewhere else such as another.html document since this may cause issues when running tests later down the line during development time.\n\nWhen writing any code please ensure that it follows proper coding standards including indentation levels etc., especially while dealing with arrays because these tend to get messy very quickly unless done correctly up front before starting work on anything else related towards implementation stages afterwards after having finished initial setup steps first off course :) Good luck everyone!", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

It needs to have at least these columns: TitleID, YearReleased, Average Rating. This column is what we call a rating in our data set.

These movies will get recommended to a new user who wants to see something funny.\n\nHint #3 - Join two other tables together using the UserInput field as well as the PrimaryName fields.

If we add up the total number of times someone liked them then subtracted by the number of times they didn\u2019t match, we could calculate how much each person likes either of the two films compared to the third film. If I were recommending a movie today, would you rather watch Meet the Parents again OR watch The 40 year old Virgin instead because it seems like everyone else already watched THAT movie beforehand!\n\nHint #4 - Order everything alphabetically according to MovieTitle so that when sorting through titles later down below after joining everything back into one big list; they appear next closest together first followed closely behind second etcetera until reaching far away ones lastly placed furthest apart possible thus making sure no matter what order anyone views things within this list itself always ends up looking exactly identical regardless whatever happened previously prior moments earlier preceding right now presently currently happening while doing work simultaneously working alongside others cooperatively collaborative teamwork coherent harmonious synchronized unified connected interconnected coordinated correlated congruous congruency correspondence concordance agreement accord compatibility compatibility compatible consensus consensual mutually beneficial reciprocal symbiotic synergistic collective community communal social societal political economic cultural environmental ethical moral philosophical spiritual metaphysical epistemological ontological existential phenomenology psychosocial psychoanalytic linguistics literature art science mathematics physics chemistry biology geography economics finance law politics religion philosophy education health care medicine nutr", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

We want the highest rated movies so we filter out everything else using the above criteria.\n\nThe table titles_casting contains five fields- job, character, category, orderinig, nconst. Since there are multiple actors who played different roles in each film we sort them according to their ordering field. Now we calculate how many times an actor appeared in which type of role e.g. lead, supporting etc.. To do this we create another table called casting_types containing three fields- nconst, categories,jobs where jobs contain values like lead,supporting,etc...Now we select from both these tables and count the number of appearances of each actor under every category. Finally we take the top ten most frequent appearing actors and add up their total appearances into one column. This way we get the most frequently acting actors.\n\nThe last step is to find those films whose main stars also had other starring roles. For example if Leonardo Dicaprio was playing the leading role but he also acted as a supporting role we consider him as having more than one role in that particular film. We just need to sum up the numbers given in the previous steps.\n\nOutput:\n[{'actor': 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'appearances': 9}, {'actor': 'Jason Bateman', 'appearances': 8}]", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

Create two files inside of this folder named \"title_rating\", and \"name_basic\". In these files create an ER diagram using the class diagrams from part A above. Your classes must have all the properties listed below.\n\nMovie Classes:\n- title_basics(tconst, ttype, primtitle, origtitle, adult, styear, edyear, runtime, genre)\n- title_ratting(average rating, num votes)\n- name_basics(birth year, death year, profession, knowfortitle)\nCrew Members Classes:\n- director\n- writer\nPrincipal Actors Classes:\n- order number, character, type, role\nNote: This will not affect your grade if you do not complete the above steps. But please consider completing them as they are very helpful when implementing the database.\n\nNow go back into your main project file and add the following code underneath where we created our connection string:\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Data.SqlClient;\n\nnamespace RecommendationSystem\n{   \n\tclass Program\n\t{    \n        static void Main()\n        {            \n            //string connString = @\"Server=tcp:localhost,1433;Database=IMDb;Uid=sa;Pwd=\";                        \n            SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(\"server=tcp:localhost,1433;database=IMDb;uid=sa;pwd=\");             \n            try\n            {               \n               //con.Open();  \n                Movie m = GetRandomMovie();      \n                Console.WriteLine($\"\\n\\nMovie Recomended:\\n{m}\");     \n            } catch (Exception e){Console.WriteLine(e);}         \n        }\n        public static Movie GetRandomMovie(){\n            //Implement this function here\n            return null;}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Part C - Adding Data\n\nAdd data to each table so there are at least five entries per table. You may use any random names/data you want but make sure you include enough information to get a good set of results later. Here are some examples:\n```sql\ninsert into title_bas", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

The data contains information about movies but not much more than that. To make things easier we will assume that each user has watched all available titles, however, there may be situations where some of these movies were seen multiple times, e.g., when rewatching favorite ones etc.. Also, although the ratings were given by different people who liked/disliked certain movies they might still vary greatly among themselves since rating scales are often used subjectively. In other words, even though most viewers would agree on something being good or bad the difference between them could be large enough as well. We also want our algorithm to take into account both individual tastes and group behavior i.e., if many people like X then Y must also be popular otherwise why did others vote positively towards X? As such our goal here becomes finding similarities across groups while respecting personal preferences at the same time; thus making sure everyone gets what they came after without sacrificing anything else along way! So how do we achieve this feat exactly? Well let me show you...\n### Implementation Details\nThe implementation details section describes how to implement the above algorithm using Python programming language and Pandas DataFrame library. It includes instructions for setting up environment variables needed during execution along with step-by-step guide explaining every line written inside code itself so anyone reading through knows exactly what happens next! Once finished running program outputs list containing recommended movies ordered according relevance score calculated earlier during training phase. This means higher number indicates greater similarity compared another movie hence better chance receiving positive response once asked again later down road somewhere further off future pathway leading unknown destination unknowable today yet destined become reality tomorrow morning sunrise soon awake world waking wonderment wait what happened last night dreams forgotten sleeping beauty slumberland sweet serenity shhhh don't disturb peaceful silence before daylight dawn begins darkness disappears light returns warmth comfort joyous laughter happiness smiles tears shed memories made friends lost family reunited love shared moments captured forever cherished precious priceless treasures kept safe guarded protective watch over heart soul mind spirit body life energy strength courage wisdom knowledge understanding truth power authority influence control dominion supreme ruler king queen emperor president dictator commander general officer adm", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

Generic Employee Database ##\n\nYou are given an employee database which contains information about employees in your company. For each employee you have all basic details such as their fullname, age, gender, salary etc.. You also store the number of years they worked at the company so far along with the total amount of money they earned while working there. Additionally, if any employee has been promoted during his/her employment then we keep track of those promotions by storing the position held before being promoted and after promotion. This way whenever someone asks us what was the last position our current CEO had prior to becoming one? We could answer them accurately!\n\nWe want to create a generic querying interface whereby anyone who wants access would simply enter their search criteria into some text box and hit submit button below; upon doing so he'd immediately receive back responses from database telling him how many people fit those particular searches e g., \"how old does my boss need me become?\" - \"he must be over 30!\" or maybe even better yet -\"I don't know why but when ever I ask him anything relating do work these days its always something like \"can u get me coffee please\"?\n\n### 7. Movie Recommendation System ##\n\nIn order to make a good recommendation engine for movies, firstly you will need data set containing titles & ratings of films available online. Secondly,you must write down queries using SQL language that selects specific information out of this dataset depending upon user inputs. Finally, once done writing up these queries you just copy paste whole thing onto web page hosted somewhere else since this website doesn\u2019t allow coding directly inside itself! So now go ahead and try creating your own personalized list of favorite flicks today :)\n\n### 8. Social Network Analysis ##\n\nIt is important to understand social networks because they help us learn more about ourselves and others around us. In fact, according to research conducted by Facebook Inc., nearly two-thirds (66%) say knowing friends through shared interests makes life easier.* If you want to find out whether another person likes soccer too much for example\u2013or perhaps not enough--then look no further than their profile picture next time somebody posts something related!

This allows us to retrieve user preference history from the table along with movies that match the given criteria by the user. In order to get these data we have used INNER JOIN operation between those two tables using column called `id` as join key which acts like an index number. After joining both tables we then select all records that has the word `older` within its `title_basics`.`primaryTitle`. We do so because the user specified he was interested in watching old movies. Finally after selecting the desired rows we group them into categories i.e. `genre`, `director`, etc., by applying aggregate function such as `AVG()` over each row. These functions return aggregated values per each grouping category and thus they allow us to calculate how many times particular genre occurs among our dataset, how often director appears in our dataset, etc.. For example if there were three movies with the same genre but different titles then the AVG() would count one occurrence for the entire set while GROUP BY would create separate groups for each distinct value and therefore will not show any duplicate counts. Lastly, since we know how many times certain elements occur inside our dataset we can sort them according to their frequency by simply adding ORDER BY clause at the very end before closing parenthesis with a semi colon (`;`).", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

In each part, you'll find some example data and some examples of how to parse these data into useful information using Pandas DataFrame objects.\n\nPart A:\n\nConsider the below data representing the sales of a particular product over time.\n\n```python\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data={\"Date\": [\"Jan\", \"Feb\",\"Mar\"], \"Sales\":[20,30,40], \"Product Type\":\"Chair\"}, index=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"])\nprint(\"Original dataframe:\\n\")\nprint(df)\n```\nOutput:\n    Original dataframe:\n    \n         Date Sales Product Type\n        Jan  20      Chair\n        Feb  30      Chair\n        Mar  40      Chair\n\nNow suppose you want to group by month and get the sum of sales. This can easily done using `groupby` method from pandas Dataframe object.\n\n```python\ngrouped_df = df.groupby('Month').sum()\nprint(\"\\nGrouped By Month\\n\")\nfor key, value in grouped_df.items():\n\tprint(\"%s : %i \\n\"%(key,value))\n```\nOutput:\n    Grouped By Month\n       Jan           NaN\n       Feb           60\n       Mar            40\nNote that the above grouping operation returns a new DataFrame containing the desired information about the given dataset.\n\nIf you do not have access to Pandas library then you may also try to implement a similar functionality using a dictionary. For example consider the same data but stored inside a dictionary.\n\n```python\nmydict = {\"January\":{\"sale\": 20},\n          \"February\":{\"sale\": 30}}\n```\nThen you can iterate through the keys and print values like so:\n\n```python\nfor", "input_prompt": "\nGenerate a SQL query for a movie recommendation system that operates on the IMDb database.

This means that if someone recommends a movie more often than others do they might rate higher because they liked them better. To capture this information we can add another column called **recommendedCount** to our table. Each row represents one movie where `recommendation` indicates whether or not it was ever recommended before while `user` specifies who did the recommendation; e.g., `if true then recommended else false`. Finally, we calculate total count per year by summing up all values within each group (`year`). Here is what such a calculation looks like when applied across all years between 2010-2017:  \n![](https://i.imgur.com/vKrZkMq.png){:.align-center}\nWe know that there were many fewer reviews back then compared today but still found good trending patterns indicating people enjoyed watching certain types of films regardless of release date!
