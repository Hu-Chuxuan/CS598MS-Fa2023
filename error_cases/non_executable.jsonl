Your code MUST run successfully if no WHERE clause exists.\n\n```sql\nmysql> select * from name_basics;\n+---------------+-----+----------+-----------+------+\n| primaryName   | bday | deathtime | profession | id  |\n+---------------+-----+----------+-----------+------+\n| Aaron Eckhart |    68 |        73 | actor    |    1 |\n| Adrian Brody   |     45 |        NA | actor    |    2 |\n| Al Pacino      |      81 |         91 | actor    |    3 |\n| Alec Baldwin   |      63 |          68 | actor    |    4 |\n| Ben Affleck   |     48 |           48 | director |    5 |\n| Bruce Willis   |      66 |            66 | actor    |    6 |\n| Charlie Sheen  |     57 |         57 | actor    |    7 |\n| Clint Eastwood |      89 |         93 | director |    8 |\n| Colin Farrell  |     45 |          45 | actor    |    9 |\n| Daniel Radcliffe |     32 |         NaN | actor    |   10 |\n| Denzel Washington |      66 |         66 | actor    |   11 |\n| Edward Norton  |     49 |          49 | actor    |   12 |\n| Emma Watson    |     29 |         29 |"}

We have provided two datasets as CSV files called `movies` and `actors`. They each contain three tables of actors, ratings and titles. These tables were generated from information found at http://www.imdb.com/interfaces/. Each table contains a column called `id`, which we used to create our partitions.\nWe want to find all actors who appear in more than one rated movie. To do so, first extract the `actor_id`s into separate tables, then use those tables along with the other ones to determine if there's any overlap between the ids. If so, return both actor names and the number of times they appeared together.\nThe dataset has been split into four parts. All four must be submitted separately.\n\nPart I: Extract Actor IDs\n- Load the `movie` file into your database. This file contains the table `title_ratings`, which includes the column `rating_average`. For every row where `rating_average >= 6` and `rating_average <= 7`, add the value of the `actor_id` field to the list `mylist` in a temporary table named `tmpTableActorIdList`:\n    ```sql\n     SELECT mylist INTO tmpTableActorIdList\n      FROM title_ratings\n      JOIN title ON title.id = title_ratings.title_id\n       AND title_ratings.rating_average BETWEEN 6 AND 7\n   ;\n   ```\n\n- Write another script that loads the `actors` file into your database and creates a new temp table named `tmpTableActorNames`:\n    ```sql\n        INSERT INTO tmpTableActorNames(name) VALUES ('');\n        FOR i IN (SELECT id AS actorID\n                    FROM public.title_ratings\n                ) LOOP\n            INSERT INTO tmpTableActorNames(name) VALUES('' || i.actorID);\n        END LOOP;\n    ```\n- Create a view that joins these two tables together:\n    ```sql\n         CREATE VIE"}

Your next step will be to improve your previous solution from challenge number one so that more movies are recommended than before in a shorter time frame while using less resources/memory.\n\nYou may add any additional functionality as long as they do not change the structure of the data stored within the IMDB database. For example, if your initial implementation required sorting through all titles each time a new user was added then you could use an index instead which would allow usernames to be found faster since we already know what we're looking for. This means that when someone searches again later down line after watching another movie we don\u2019t needlessly check every possible combination because there isn't anything left over anymore thanks to indexing techniques like B-tree indexes etc..\n\nIn order to complete this final part please submit your improved version along with screenshots demonstrating how much better things look compared against earlier iterations where nothing had changed except perhaps some minor tweaks here & there due mostly outdated code being replaced w/ newer versions (which hopefully doesn't happen often)."}

In this exercise we will expand upon your previous work by generating multiple SQL queries as well as adding additional features such as sorting and filtering.\n\nFirstly let's extend our existing code so that we are able to select more than one user preference at once. We do this by introducing another table in our schema called \"user_preferences\" where each row represents a different set of preferred films. This new column also allows us to sort the list of recommended titles according to how many times they have been selected by individual users. Finally we add two filters; either displaying all available options regardless of whether any were previously chosen OR selecting those items which match both sets of preferences given above. To test out these changes try running them through again using your current implementation!\n\nNow suppose someone asks about other types/genre etc...of movies similar too ones already seen before? How would u answer him then?? What kinda info would u require first off?? And what exactly does similarity mean here???\n\nWe could use cosine similarity between vectors representing each film's genre. If the sum over all terms in one vector equals zero then there exists no relationship between these two items since every term has opposite sign values when added together due to negative signs used within formulas like e^x +/- y = z.\n\n### 06-09 - Expanding Our Movie Database\n\nExpand our database to include all of the following fields:\n* A field containing the number of votes per movie (votes).\n* A field containing the rating score (ratingScore).\n* An extra boolean column indicating if the movie contains explicit content (containsExplicitContent).\n* Add a third table linking people and their favourite actors and actresses into the system (peopleFavouritesTable).\nThis table will contain three columns: personID int autoincrement PRIMARY KEY not null FK references People table; actorID int autoincrement NOT NULL REFERENCES"}

A JOIN statement allows us to bring together data from two different tables into one table. This helps us get more information about our data than if we were using an individual select statement for each of these tables alone. For example, let's say we wanted all movies released after 2016 but before 2020 where there are at least five reviews written by people who liked them very much according to some criteria specified earlier - then we could simply write something like \"select * FROM titles JOIN ratings ON rated = true\" which would return everything we asked for because both conditions apply simultaneously thanks largely due its clever implementation behind scenes involving joins etc..\n\n**Hint #2**: There may also exist other ways besides joins such as nested subqueries within SELECT clauses themselves ect... However those methods tend not work well unless carefully crafted otherwise they often produce unexpected results so please don't try anything fancy here :) Instead focus solely upon what was given above while keeping things simple yet effective enough for now until next time when maybe another hint comes along later down road perhaps even right away depending how fast response rate goes up again once everyone starts getting back online soon hopefully anyway........."}

This reduces the number of reads required for each subsequent request resulting in faster response times. \n\nIn this scenario we are going to create a cache table called \"CacheTable\" that contains all movies and ratings aggregated over a week period. Whenever there is a request for any particular rating information during that same timeframe then our code would just look up its corresponding row in CacheTable rather than recalculating everything again as if was completely fresh everytime someone made another request.\n\n#### Expected Outputs/Results:\nAggregation of Movie Ratings across Week\nMovie Name | Average Rating| Number of Voters  \n-----------|--------------|--------------------  \nPulp Fiction(1994)|8.5           |216                   \nFight Club (1999)|8.6            |181            \nBack To The Future Trilogy(1985\u20131990)|8.5          |27     \nSaving Private Ryan (1998)|9               |19       \nTerminator(1984)|7              |17        \n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE CACHETABLE AS SELECT title_ratings.*,(SUM((rating)) OVER (PARTITION BY title_ratings.titleID) AS avgRatings,COUNT(*)AS votes)FROM title_ratings GROUP BY title_ratings.titleid ORDER BY avgratings DESC LIMIT 5;\nINSERT INTO CACHEtable values ('Pulp fiction','8.5','216');\nINSERT INTO CACHTable VALUES('Fight club','8.6','181');\nINSERT INTO CACHTable Values('Back to future trilogy','8.5','27');\nINSERT INTO CACHTable Values('Saving private ryan','9','19');\nINSERT INTO CACHTable Values('Terminator','7','17') ;\nUPDATE Cachet"}

The same holds true for the set {{1}, {2}} in the partially ordered set <{1}, {2}> which is a proper subset of {1, 2}. However, {1, 2} does not form any partial order because there are no comparisons between them.\nIn general, we say that two elements x and y are related if they have some sort of relation. In particular, we will assume that every element has exactly one predecessor and successor. For example, the elements {1, 2} are said to be related by the strict total order <1, 2> where 1 precedes 2. Similarly, <1, 2>, <2, 1>, and <1, 1> also hold as relations but none of these three relations define a partial order. We now introduce the concept of a partial order: A binary relation R over a non-empty set X is called a partial order if every pair of distinct members of X appears at most once in R. This definition allows us to talk about the least upper bound and greatest lower bound of an arbitrary element x\u2208X. It turns out that these bounds always exist provided the domain X is finite.\n\nConsidering the above definitions, design a class POSet that models sets of numbers. Your model should include operations such as \"isSubsetOf\", \"inverse\", and \"contains\". Furthermore, your implementation should support membership queries using regular expressions.\n\nExample Usage:\nPOSet poset = new POSet(); // Create empty set\nposet.add(new int[] {1});    // Add integers to the set\nSystem.out.println(\"Is {} part of the set? :\" + poset.isMember(new int[]{}));   // returns false since { } is not contained within the set\n// Add another integer to the set\nint[] i = {9};\nposet.addAll(i);      // add {9} to the set\nSystem.out.println(\"Are {} and {}\" different? :\" + poset."}

Each type entity consists of some common attributes such as id, userId, statusId, timestamp, content, etc. Users are allowed to post tweet messages in the form of text or image/video links. They also have the ability to retweet other people's posts by selecting from one of the existing Tweets posted previously. Retweeting allows users to gain more followers and improve reputation while increasing engagement within the network.\n\nThe design must include the following tables:\n\n- A table for storing all information about each User. This includes basic personal details along with any additional data they may choose to share publicly via their profile page e.g., location, bio description etc... These fields will not necessarily appear directly after creating an account but instead could become visible at later stages when certain actions occur during usage. For example: clicking \u201cedit\u201d button would open up editing options where you\u2019ll see those extra pieces of info displayed clearly alongside your main profile picture & background color selections!\n- Another table containing everything related specifically towards posting new Status updates online through Twitter itself i.e.: what kinda message did u send out there? When was ur last activity date recorded here too?? And finally how many times were u actually logged into twitter today? All these things combined together make up exactly who u r right now :)\n- Finally another table dedicated solely towards tracking down exactly WHO RETWEETED YOU!! So if someone else liked something u said then they get added automatically onto our list over time so we know exactly whose opinion matters most around here ;)"}

Then run `php artisan serve` in your terminal. This will open up a web browser pointing at localhost:8000 by default.\n\nYou may also access http://localhost:8000/public/index.html if you've installed Laravel Mix.\n\n## Step 3 - Install dependencies & migrations\nInside of your project folder execute `$ npm i && cd public/` then inside the directory execute `npm run dev`, which will download all necessary node modules required for the project and copy them into the `/public` directory where they are needed. Afterwards, navigate back to the root directory via `cd../..` then enter `composer require --dev brian2694/laravel-mix` followed by `composer dumpautoload`. Run `npm run dev` again from within the root directory now to reinstall any missing node modules.\nNow we have our development environment ready! We can now proceed with creating migration files for our new model. Firstly go to the command line and navigate to your app folder via `cd /path/to/your/app/folder`. Enter `./vendor/bin/migrator make:migration` after opening the console window, this will give us a file named `2017_11_15_000000_create_movies_table.php` in our migrations table. Open this file and change the contents as follows:\n```php\n<?php\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Schema;\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Schema\\Blueprint;\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Migrations\\Migration;\nclass Movies extends Migration {\n    /**\n     * Run the migrations.\n     *\n     * @return void\n     */\n    public function up() {\n        Schema::create('movies', function( Blueprint $table ) {\n            // Define column names here...\n\t\t\t//...and"}

This new table contains information about how similar two movies are. For example, if you have two movies A and B then they will both contain entries for each other like so; `[A,B]` and `[B,A]`. This means that we know which movies are most likely to appeal to people who liked another particular movie. We want to use these relationships between different titles to build our recommending engine by using a matrix factorisation algorithm such as SVD. In order to do this, write code that generates a SQL query which allows us to compute the similarity score between any pair of movies. It must return a number indicating whether the relationship is stronger than chance (`>.5`) or not (`<=.5`).\n\nExample input:\n\n```\n[1,'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)', ['Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004), Uncle Buck'] ]\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n\n```\n[1,'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)', ['Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004), Uncle Buck'], [1,'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)','Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)] ]\n```"}

Retrieves data about the given title type e.g. animated, comedy etc\n        ```python\n        def getRecomndations(self):\n            print(\"Retrieving information...\")\n            \n            # Retrieve the rating of the requested film based on its genre\n            # If no ratings exist then display message indicating so\n            if self.__ratingExists():\n                return self._genreToAverage()\n            else:\n                print(\"\\nNo rating exists.\\n\")\n                \n            # Return the number of votes per title type along with total vote count\n            # If no votes exist then display message indicating so\n            if self.__votingExist():\n                return self._numberOfVotePerGenre()\n            else:\n                print(\"\\nNo voting"}

This would allow you to return more accurate recommendations by ensuring the movie has actors/actresses who are also in other movies which have been watched previously. For example if I wanted to watch a comedy film then I may want to see actors/actresses who starred together again so they could appear in another future film where my friends and family might enjoy watching them too. However, this constraint needs further consideration because there isn\u2019t always an exact match between two people e.g. George Clooney appears alongside Julia Roberts twice yet he doesn\u2019t share any films with her apart from Ocean Eleven! So perhaps we shouldn\u2019t count these matches when calculating our score? What do you think?\n\n### Part C - 5 marks ###\nThis part involves creating your own database schema and populating it with data from external sources. To get started simply create three new tables named `movies`,`reviews`and `users`. Next add some sample records into each table using the information below:\n* Movie Name = Star Wars Episode III Revenge Of The Sith (2005)\n* Average Rating = 8.3 / 10\n* Num Voters = 1000+\n* Start Year = 2005\n* End Year = 2005\n* Genres = Sci-Fi & Fantasy\n* Title Type = Feature Film\n* Primary Actors = Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Samuel L Jackson etc\u2026\n* Primary Director(s)/Writer(s)= George Lucas & Steven Spielberg\n\nNext insert reviews for each movie by selecting random ones off IMDB website until all slots within each row are filled out completely before moving onto next record etc.. Finally save everything back into respective databases after making sure no errors occur during process otherwise repeat steps starting over again until successful completion achieved successfully accomplished!!

Use the adjacency list representation of graphs as implemented by `networkx`. Your implementation must use at least one recursive function call but no more than two recursive calls per iteration through your algorithm.\n\nEulerian Paths are paths around a closed loop so you have to visit each vertex exactly once. A cycle is formed when there exists a sequence of vertices such that any pair of adjacent vertices share both edges between them. This means that if we remove either edge from the cycle then we will not form another cycle. For example, consider these three cycles:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZBgYHUb.png)\n\nThis first picture has four nodes connected via four edges, forming a cycle. We could break up the cycle into smaller ones like this:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lKuDQJO.png)\n\nWe could also reorganize our diagram slightly to get something else out of it!\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mjMqCXo.png)\n\nIn fact, given any node v we can find a cycle which contains just v. And since every node appears in some cycle we know that all possible cycles exist somewhere within the graph. However, finding all those cycles quickly becomes difficult especially because they may overlap. So instead let's try to see how many cycles contain each individual vertex...\n\nA simple way would be to count how often each vertex occurs along its own \"loop\" - e.g., counting how many times I pass myself while walking around town! But what happens if my loops cross? Well suppose I walk down Main Street until I reach Broadway whereupon I turn right onto Second Avenue before continuing straight ahead again towards Third Place etc.. Now imagine doing this repeatedly forever! How does knowing whether certain streets intersect affect things? Let us say we want to determine whether there exists *"}

This will allow us not just one but multiple possible suggestions which are more likely going appeal better than others because we know exactly what kinda stuff interests him/her most so far!\n\nThis means there could potentially exist some sort \"personalization engine\" whereby given certain inputs about oneself(i.e., age range), then it would return back relevant content according those specific criteria set forth by said individual person themselves via whatever interface was chosen at time being used.

We are going to use a collaborative filtering approach where each user's ratings of songs in different musical styles will help us predict which new style they might enjoy listening too!\n\nWe have the lastfm api endpoint at https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=album.getinfo&api_key={YOUR LAST FM KEY HERE}&user=%{USERNAME}%&artist=%{ARTISTS NAME}\nThis endpoint returns information about an album by artist {ARTISTS NAME}. In our case we want to retrieve all artists who play similar types of music as the one specified by the user. For example if we specify \"The Beatles\" then the response would include other bands such as \"Beatles\", \"John Lennon\", \"Paul McCartney\".\n\n**Input Parameters:**\n- username : Your own username from last fm\n- artistsname : Artists name whom you wish to know more albums from. It could also just be your favorite band name etc..\n\nTo solve this problem you must first get the list of most popular artists from lastfm through its web service endpoint described above. After obtaining these top artists you need to write a script that iteratively tries to find out what is the similarity between any two given artists. To do so you may consider using cosine distance metric. This means that every pair of artists will have a score ranging between [-1, +1]. If there exists another pair whose scores sum up to -1 or +1 then those pairs will be considered similar. Finally you should create a dataframe containing the most recommended artists according to the scores calculated before hand.\n\nExample Dataframe Output:\n|artist_name |similarityScore|\n|--------------|--------------------|\n|The Beatles    |  .9              |\n|Pink Floyd     |     .6           |\n|Bruce Springsteen       |         .2         |\n\n**Output Format:**"}

Movie Recommendation System - Part II\n\nThe previous part generated a list of movies by actors/director(s). Now we want to extend our model further so as to include other criteria such as genre. We also wish to know how many times each user has rated an item before generating any recommendation lists. For example, if you rate two items then your rating history will contain two entries but if you rate three more items in addition to those previously rated, there are now five ratings stored against you. In order to do this, add another column called `numVote` into the `title_ratings` table which stores number of votes casted per user-item pairing. Use this information when constructing your final SQL query. Your SQL query must return a list of recommended titles ordered according to their popularity among people who share similar taste like yours.\n\n### 3. User Profile Update System\n\nYou've already built a great recommender engine! But what about updating profiles? Users may change their interests over time and therefore you might want to update their profile accordingly. This means that whenever someone changes his/her preference, you would store these new values along with old ones so that future queries could take them into account. To achieve this goal, create a view named \"userProfile\" containing both current and past preferred categories separated by commas i.e.: \"Movies & TV Shows\". Then use this view instead of hardcoding individual entries inside every request handler method call; otherwise, you risk making incorrect assumptions about certain fields due to missing data points during testing phase etc.."}

Your API should accept two parameters through HTTP GET requests: firstly, the user's search term ('IMDb Search Term') and secondly, the number of recommendations requested per page ('Recommendation Limits'). For example, if the search term was 'Sex And The City Movie' then the recommended list would consist of the top three suggestions for each genre available within the IMDb data set. So, there could potentially be six different lists returned depending upon how many genres exist within the data set. Each individual list should contain no more than ten items per listing (this means that the maximum possible number of elements to display on one page may not exceed thirty-six)."}

This time around your challenge is different because instead of generating a query that would return the top five recommended movies by using user preference history from previous queries submitted to the API, you are now required to write an algorithm in Python which takes into account other factors such as how many times each genre has appeared over all past submissions made through its respective API endpoint (i.e., `genre/getAll`).\n\nYour task is simple yet challenging since there could potentially exist multiple solutions depending upon what data points were taken into consideration while constructing said algorithmic approach towards solving these problems presented herein below:\nThe first thing we must do before beginning our work is gather information regarding every possible combination between each parameter type available within this application framework so far including but not limited too : `titleID`,`titleType`,`primaryTitle`, etc... These values come directly outta db tables where all relevant info gets stored after being retrieved via sql query executions against them respectively. After getting everything set up correctly let us proceed onto creating actual functions themselves inside python program itself!!!\n\nOnce completed successfully,we move forward towards writing code blocks which actually performs necessary operations according specific criteria given earlier mentioned steps above :)"}

We will use the IMDB dataset in order to train our model and we will also make some modifications to the data so that your neural network classifier has enough information about each user\u2019s taste.\nThe modified version of the IMDB dataset contains two new fields, \u201cpreferences\u201d and \u201creviews\u201d, which are described below:\nPreferences: Each row now includes the list of movies liked by its respective user. This field contains values like [\"Avatar\", \"Black Swan\"] etc., where every value corresponds to a different movie.\nReviews: Each row now includes the review score given by each user towards the corresponding film. For example if a user gave Avatar a score of 8/10 then his preference would have been updated from [\"Avatar\",\"BlackSwan\"].\nThe goal of the project is to create a machine learning framework capable of generating accurate movie recommendations when presented with a set of unseen titles. In addition to implementing the above mentioned dataset, you must consider how to build a prediction model that incorporates both user preferences and reviews into account while making predictions.\nYou may assume that all of the training data consists of positive examples such that any given instance is either a positive example or not; i.e., there no negative samples available during training time. Your final solution should include code snippets demonstrating how to load the dataset and perform feature engineering before passing them through various layers within the deep neural network architecture chosen by yourself!\n\n#### Feature Engineering\nWe know that features play important role in building effective models because they help us understand what kind of patterns exist between inputs & outputs. So let me tell u something interesting here : if ur teacher asks U why did U choose CNN instead NN? Then answer him back saying \u201d because CNN uses Convolutional Layers whereas NN does not!"}

In particular, you will implement an algorithm called Collaborative Filtering which leverages user ratings and reviews as well as the similarity between movies in order to make personalized recommendations.\nYou will first learn about Collaborative filtering algorithms from scratch before applying them into your own implementation. Once again, no programming language is required; you are free to choose any text editor such as Notepad++/Sublime Text/VSCode etc.. Just write down all your work and submit it via Canvas!\n\n**Task Details & Instructions**  \n\n#### Part I : Collaborative Filtering Algorithms\n\nRead up these articles:\n* [What Is Collaborative Filtering?](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/08/collaborative-filtering/) by Analytic Vidhya\n* [Collaborative Filtering](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_modules/sklearn/experimental/feature_extraction.html?highlight=tfidf#TFIDFTransformer) tutorial documentation by SciKit Learn\n\nIn addition, here is also another resource to help you get started: https://github.com/jimmyguo/movie_recsys\n\nThen answer the questions below:\n\n1. What does collaborative filter mean? How do they work? Explain in detail step by step including the assumptions made when implementing CF algorithms.\n2. Write out a pseudocode of what would happen if someone were to enter a new item into a recommender system that uses CF algorithms.\n3. Compare and contrast different types of CF algorithms. Which one do you think works best for our scenario? Why so? Do you believe there is ever a situation where other type(s) may perform better than the ones mentioned above? If yes, then explain why and give examples.\n\n\n#### Part II : Implementation\n\nUsing Python code, complete the following tasks:\n\n1. Create two lists named `user` and `item"}

In order to get an accurate answer from this table we must know what are these numbers representing? We will have to refer back to our previous question where we had to find out which column in a table contains the most information about the topic of interest. This time around let us focus on finding the average rating since this number represents how much people liked the film so if there was one particular film that received more positive reviews than others then its average rating may be higher than other films and therefore a good recommendation as well!\n\nThe first thing you might notice when looking at both columns together is that they don\u2019t seem very different from each other \u2013 but wait until later because now comes another interesting point worth mentioning here before moving forward any further\u2026..\n\n#### Name Basic Table\nNow let me tell you why do we care about those two columns again after having found them useful earlier during our last assignment? Well basically because unlike titles ratings table above which holds just one piece information per entry (i.e., average rating), name basic table offers additional info such as actor/actress names etcetera thus making it easier for computer programs working behind scenes while processing huge amounts data coming directly off internet into memory locations quickly enough not causing performance issues due slowness caused by lack clarity between different types entries within same dataset!!!\n\nNow onto next part...\n\n### Solution\nI am going to use a combination of `UNION` statements along with some aggregation functions inside my query statement. These aggregate functions allow us to take all the rows present in either table(s) being queried and group them up according certain criteria set forth ahead-of-time using specific parameters passed through command line interface (CLI).\n\nWhen performing JOIN operations against multiple tables simultaneously via UNION ALL operator, MySQL automatically assumes default behavior unless otherwise specified explicitly through parameter settings provided upon execution initiation process itself.* Note however that even though joins performed via UNION ALl operator tend towards being slightly slower compared those done using INNER JOINS alone still remain relatively quicker than traditional methods involving nested loops over entire datasets available within given context!!\n\n*See also : https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/union.html"}

This combined table is called a \"join\" of those two tables.\n\nUsing the same Movie Database you used before in parts b &c, create a new table named `movie_actors` which contains information about actors who have appeared in multiple films such as their names and roles they played in each film. Create another table named `movies_with_actor`, where there are records for every actor appearing in more than one film. Use join statements to combine these tables so that we get a list of all actors who appear in both films, along with the titles of the films. \n\nYou may also want to add some additional columns if necessary. For example, if an actor appears in more than one role within the same film then you would want to record this fact by adding a column indicating whether they play the lead character, supporting character etc.. It might look something like this after combining everything up...  \n\n| Movie | Title     | Year    | Actress      | Role                          |\n| :--- | ---       | :------ | :------------- | :-------------------------- |\n| Castaway | Tom Hanks | 2000    | Helen Hunt     | Chuck Noland              |\n| Castaway | Tom Hanks | 2000    | Chris Cooper   | Ben Rand           <-- Lead Character\n| Castaway | Tom Hanks | 2000    | Bill Paxton     | Ned Deckler            <-- Supporting Character\n| Extremely Loud And Incredibly Close | Viola Davis   | 2011        | Grandma Mayer<-- Lead Charater\n| Extremely Loud And Incredibly Close | Max von Sydow | 2011        | Otto Quinn             <-- Supporting Character\n\nNow, let\u2019s say we wanted to find out how many times each actress has acted alongside her husband?

That means if someone asks for something new then we want our query to find similar items rather than having to scan through all the existing records again. We will not change anything about how these items are stored within any table structure so there won\u2019t be any changes made here either! Instead what needs improving upon would be how often do they look up each item which could potentially take longer depending on whether its being searched against itself everytime OR just once per day etc.. To help speed things along even further though \u2013 let me introduce another parameter called \u201cfrequency\u201d where instead of always running off current date + timestamp value(s), instead allow us specify exactly when we wish those searches happen next instead? For example say today happens between 8am till midnight tomorrow morning & therefore might mean searching twice during that period whereas yesterday happened around noon thus meaning maybe once since everything else remains constant throughout rest days except maybe holiday periods like Christmas Day etc\u2026\n\n#### Solution Description:\nYou have been given two options for solving part b of the problem statement below:\nOption A: This option involves creating a new column called `date_created`. It stores the datetime when a record was created into this field. Whenever a user enters his search term, he will also enter some information regarding the frequency of search requests such as daily or weekly etc... If there exists multiple entries with different frequencies associated with particular records then we check first entry against latest entry found after sorting according to ascending order of dates recorded inside `date_created` column followed by checking second most recent until matching one occurs otherwise return null value back indicating failure while performing comparison"}

Your diagram must include at least two actors (users), three processes, four artifacts, five associations, six messages between actors/processes and seven lifelines.\nUse Case Diagrams are used to describe how objects interact within a business process. They help us understand what actions take place during each step of our software development life cycle and who participates in these steps. A Use Case Diagram consists of various elements such as Actors (the people involved in performing certain tasks), Processes (actions taken by those actors), Artifacts (data generated through interactions between actors & processes), Associations (connections formed among different entities like relationships between individuals), Messages sent back-and-forth between them all over time frames called Lifecycles which show when things happen e.g., \"After purchase\", etcetera..."}

Create an ETL process from JSON data into BigQuery using PubSub - 5 points\nIn this challenge you will create an ELT pipeline in Google Cloud Platform by creating a Dataflow job which uses Pubsub as its source. The purpose of your pipeline is to transform data received through pub sub messages into bigquery. Your data will come from the following pub sub topic: https://pubsub-tester.googleapis.com/topics/google-cloud-dataflow-samples-data-for-etl. This message has been predefined and contains three json files. You must parse each file individually and load them into bigquery separately. Each file is loaded into different table depending upon the content of the file. For example, one file may contain user profile information whereas another file may contain product sales details etc..\nYou must use the schema provided below when parsing these files into bigquery. You do not have access to any other schemas so please follow exactly what we've written here. In addition, since you are loading these files into separate tables, make sure there is no duplication between the two tables even though they share similar fields. Finally, after loading all three files into bigquery, write a final sql statement which selects all rows from both tables combined together to show how many products were sold per country overall.\nSchema:\n`country_name varchar(5)` `product_sales float` `user_profile_info varchar(20)` `product_price decimal(10,2)` `total_revenue int`\n\n### 9.

Your implementation must use the MySQLdb package provided as part of the Python standard library. You may also make use of other libraries from PyPi if you wish but they cannot be used instead of the MySQLDB library.\n\n#### Step One - Create a Database Connection\n\nCreate a connection object called conn which accepts parameters mysqlhost, usertable and password. These values correspond to the hostname, table and user credentials specified in the first question.\n\n```python\nconn = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', passwd=password, db=\"imdb\")\nprint(\"Connected Successfully!\")\n```\n\n#### Step Two - Generate Movie Titles\n\nCreate a function get_movie() that takes no arguments and returns a list containing all movies within the imdb database. Use the cursor attribute of the connection object created above to execute a SELECT statement against the imdb database.\n\n```python\ndef get_movies():\n    return cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM title').fetchall()\n```\n\n#### Step Three - Generate User Ratings\n\nNext we want to create another function named get_rating(). This time our aim is to retrieve ratings for each title returned by get_title(). We do not yet have access to any data relating to titles so we need to perform some queries at this point.\n\nFirstly we need to find out what rating type exists for every title. There are four types; adult, drama, horror and sci-fi/fantasy. To achieve this we need to run the following select statements:\n\n```sql\nselect count(*) as cnt from `title` where ttype == 'adult';\nselect count(*) as cnt from `title` where ttype == 'drama';\nselect count(*) as cnt from `title` where ttype == 'horror';\nselect count(*) as cnt from `title` where ttype =='sci-fi/fantasy';\n```\n\nEach one of these queries returns a"}

For each user preference history item, create another table called \"userPreferenceHistory\" which contains all the information about that particular user's preference list including the user ID, preferred genre(s), number of films watched by them, etc. Your task is to write an application that can take any number of user preference histories as inputs from the command line and then generate different types of SQL queries depending upon what type of recommendations they want such as top-rated titles among those already seen by current user OR best new releases within same/similar genre(s). These generated queries will be stored into files named as \"query1\", \"query2\", etc., respectively where one file holds just one SQL query at once whereas other ones hold multiple queries together so there might not always exist enough space left inside every folder after creating all necessary folders accordingly! Finally run these created files through your local server instance running MySQL client library installed locally onto PC via pip install mysqlclient command followed by importing required modules like sqlalchemy package etcetera before starting execution process itself!!\n\n## Part C - Running your code against real data sets\n\n#### Task Description\nNow that you have implemented your algorithms in Python and tested them successfully, let\u2019s see if they work well when applied to actual datasets available online. In order to do so, first download the dataset used during training phase i.e \u201cimdb_dataset\u201d which consists of over 1 million entries containing various details related to movies e.g ratings given by users alongwith year released, genre, plot summary etc\u2026 Next step would involve splitting up said dataset according specific criteria set forth earlier while developing model namely \u201cgenre\u201d, \u201crating\u201d & \u201cyear\u201d. This way each partition becomes independent entity capable being processed separately thereby enabling us perform experiments quickly instead having wait till entire thing gets finished due lengthy processing times involved otherwise. Once done assigning labels appropriately (i.e categorizing rows belonging certain group versus others ), proceed towards final stage wherein prediction accuracy metrics viz MAPE score calculated"}

Problem Set #1 - Part B\n\nProblem Description: \nCreate an algorithm that will solve the problem of determining whether two given strings are anagrams of each other using dynamic programming.\n\nInput Format: A list of words in lowercase letters, separated by spaces. Each word has at most length 80.\nConstraints: At least one word is provided as input. No more than 1000 distinct words will ever appear in any solution produced.\nOutput Format: One line containing either \"YES\" if the two words are anagramms, otherwise \"NO\".\nSample Input: \"hello world\", \"goodbye earth\"\nSample Output: YES\nExplanation: Both hello and world contain the same set of letters in different order. Hence they are anagrams. Goodbye does not have the sequence \"lo\" anywhere whereas earth contains such sequences twice. Therefore, the first string cannot be an anagram of the second one.\n\nNotes: You may assume that both words consist only of upper case Latin alphabet letters. Also you do not need to consider special symbols like ', ; : & % @ ^ $ # < > { } | /? \\.\n\nAlgorithm:\nWe use dp[i][j], where i denotes index of current letter and j denotes position in previous string;\nif we want to check if current character c belongs to substring s then dp[i+1][s.length()-c.length()];\ndp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j]+(dp[i-1][j-1])*1; //add the cost of the best prefix to the new row\n\nNote: In my code, I used DP array which was initialized from 0 till length of the word, so I had to add +1 before calling the function.\n\n### 4.

For example, if a new user comes into our application we would like them to see movies they are most likely going to enjoy. We want to use all available data at hand such as ratings, reviews, popularity, etc...\nThe user will enter one word describing what type of film he/she wants to watch next. Your task now is to generate a list of recommendations that match the given criteria provided by the user.\n\nRequirements:\n- At least five rows returned when run against the MySQL database containing at least three different titles\n- Each row must include a title field\n- Average score of each title returned MUST NOT exceed 8 out of 10 stars\n- Popularity of each title MUST BE greater than or equal to 1%\n\nNote: Remember not to actually execute any of these SQL statements! Simply create an SQL string which represents the final statement you wish to execute. Doing so allows us to test your work before execution and gives you more flexibility over where exactly your code runs.\n\nSample Outputs:\n```sql\ntitle_name | avgScore | popularity|\n------------+----------+----------\nmovie1     |        8 |         1   |\nmovie2     |        6 |          2   |\nmovie3     |        8 |         3   |\n```"}

To do this we will use Anaconda which has its own version of Python called Anaconda Navigator. This tool allows us to easily install packages such as pip and venv through the GUI interface. If you are unsure how to download and set up conda please refer back to part II instructions below.\n\n#### Step #1 \u2013 Installation\n- Open up Anaconda Navigator by clicking the icon located at the bottom left hand corner of your screen next to the Windows key\n![](https://github.com/DataScienceNYC/MovieRecommendationsChallenge/blob/master/images/part%20IIIa-%20step%201.png?raw=true \"Install\")\n- Once opened click \u201cNew\u201d\n- Then select Python > Python 3.x > Python 3.8\n- Click Next\n- Select the folder location you would like Anaconda installed into then click Finish\n![](https://github.com/DataScienceNYC/MovieRecommendationsChallenge/blob/master/images/part%20IIIb-%20step%202.png?raw=true \"installation\")\nOnce installation is complete open up Anaconda Prompt and activate the newly created conda environment\n![](https://github.com/DataScienceNYC/MovieRecommendationsChallenge/blob/master/images/part%20IIId-%20step%203.png?raw=true \"activate\")\nNow create a new directory inside of your home directory named \u201cPython Project\u201d. Inside this directory create another one labeled \u201cMovie Recommender Challenge\u201d, then finally move yourself over there via cd /home/username/.\n![](https://github.com/DataScienceNYC/MovieRecommendationsChallenge/blob/master/images/part%20IIIf.-%2"}

Why or why not?\nAnswers may include:\n- Using stored procedures instead of hardcoding everything inside one large query; this allows us to reuse code easily across different projects and makes maintenance much easier"}

They will reward an extra bonus point each when submitted correctly.\n#### Problem #1\nYou have been given access to the entire Amazon data warehouse containing information about all of its customers over the last five years. Your manager has asked you to find out which products were purchased by customers who had previously bought certain other items. For example, she would like to know what percentage of people buying chocolate bars also buy ice cream.\n\nThe data is stored in two relational databases called Customers and Products. Both contain one table named CustomerOrderHistory. In the first table there are four fields: OrderID, CustomerID, DatePurchased and ItemNumber. Each entry corresponds to a customer order. A second table contains three fields: ID, Name, Price per Unit. This stores details of all products sold at different prices.\n\nCreate a SELECT statement using JOINS that returns the number of purchases made from any product ordered within the previous month where the price paid was more than $10. Show your work as well as the final answer.\n\n#### Solution\nThis problem requires us to join the two tables together using `INNER` joins so we can get both the required information into our result set. We do this by joining on the column `CustomerID`.\nTo get the total amount spent, we must use aggregation functions such as SUM() or AVG().\nWe then filter down to those records whose date purchase falls within the past month using `BETWEEN` statements. Finally, we check whether the item costed more than $10 by comparing against the value provided. If true, add another row with TRUE in place of FALSE.\n\nProblem #2\nYou have recently joined a new company and they want to build an internal website for employees. One requirement is that managers be able to view employee profiles including name, location, department and role. Another requirement is that every time someone updates his/her profile picture the change should automatically update across multiple pages throughout the site.\n\nWrite a SQL query that satisfies these requirements while ensuring performance isn't impacted too much due to frequent changes being made during working hours. Make sure you include appropriate indexes along with queries themselves so"}

Movie Recommendation System - Part II  \n\n#### Aggregated Data Analysis & Predictions\n\nGenerate a SQL query that will allow you to analyze aggregated data of all your previous queries from your recommendation systems and determine which genre has been most popular in terms of ratings over time. Your query must return an ordered list of genres sorted by rating.\n\nUse the same dataset as above but instead of filtering out specific titles, use the aggregator function AVG() to get averages per year across all titles. Use GROUP BY to group them into years and then ORDER BY RATING ASC so they are ranked highest first.\n\n### 7. T-SNE Visualization\n\nYou have generated some interesting visualizations of user preference histories using PCA. Now we want to take things one step further and see how different groups of people who share similar interests might cluster together according to what types of content they like best! To do this let\u2019s use another machine learning algorithm called **T-SNE** (which stands for \u201ct-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding\u201d). This technique was developed at MIT back in 2004 when researchers were trying find ways to make sense out of large datasets where there wasn\u2019t enough information about each individual item being studied\u2014like say if someone wanted me know whether my favorite color is blue or green? Well now thanks largely due these guys working hard behind closed doors somewhere deep within Cambridge MA., We don\u2019t have too worry anymore because we already know exactly what shade our beloved hue falls under :) So without any further ado here goes\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s begin by importing our library package called scikit learn along side matplotlib plotting toolkits (or matplotlibs): `import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns` Next up comes creating two new variables named \"genre\" and \"year\": `genre=pd.Categorical(df[\"Genre\"], categories=[],ordered=True)` Then finally adding column names such as `genre_names=np.array(['action','adventure'])`. Afterwards lets create an empty dictionary named df_tsne whose key/value pairs correspond respectively between genre_name string values found earlier plus integer indices representing respective indexes located"}

Your manager has been getting complaints from customers about the time they spend waiting when making deposits and withdraws. He wants your help implementing some changes into the existing program which will allow customers to make transactions faster. \nThe current application uses the following data structure:\nA table called `customers` with two fields named `customerID`, `firstname`, `lastname`.  \nAnother table called `transactions` with three fields named `transactionID`, `dateTime`, `amount`.\n\nIn addition there are six other tables related to these two main tables using foreign keys:\n1. A `users` table containing information such as username/password combinations used by staff members of the bank who perform operations like checking balances etc..\n2. An `accounts` table holding details regarding accounts held by individual people including balance amounts etc...\n3. Two more tables (`deposits`, `withdrawls`) each storing records pertaining specifically either depositing money onto someone's account OR taking out funds respectively!\n4., 5 &amp; 6 These contain transaction histories associated with those specific types of actions listed above e.g.: If user X made $10 worth of purchases today then we would see all transactions involving them during said period inside one particular record within our history table(s).\n\n**Note:** All customer ID\u2019s must begin with \u201cC\u201d followed immediately afterward by four digits representing their unique number within our entire population base i.e.\u201dC-####\u201d. For example if John Smith were ever assigned ID number 9876 than his full identifier would appear thusly : \u201cC-0009876\u201d. We also require that any transaction performed between different individuals MUST always include both parties involved in order ensure proper tracking purposes remain intact throughout execution process. So instead say Bob makes purchase via check payable directly towards Joe whose name appears alongside address line item detailing payment method type selected namely CHECK. Now since these two guys already exist separately underneath separate tables prior mentioned earlier they could easily access another persons info simply enough provided appropriate permissions granted accordingly.\n\nNow let us consider how things might"}

To do so we will use the IMDB dataset provided by Kaggle which contains information about over 50K different movies along with their ratings. Your task is to implement a fully connected multi-layer perceptron neural network model which can take an input of genre preference(s), rating range and number of actors as inputs and return top N recommended movies according to these criteria.\n\nNote : The first two lines of your code should contain imports required for the project. Please refer to https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-of-python-and-keras for more details.\n\n### 3 - Sentiment Analysis With Naive Bayes Classifier ###\n\nYou have been given access to the Twitter sentiment analysis dataset from Kaggle.

For example if someone were looking for actors who starred as \"Captain Kirk\" then knowing how many movies he appeared in would help narrow down potential candidates since some might not fit into certain criteria set forth by viewers seeking out specific types/genre's etc...\n\nOnce we know exactly which fields make sense together then comes figuring out where those values come from i.,e.. Which field links directly back onto another one allowing us access through joins between two separate sets of data sources e.g.: Titles -> Genres -> Ratings -> Characters Etcetera.... If everything works correctly once combined into one cohesive unit there shouldn't really ever be any problems accessing whatever type info needed depending upon user preference settings during setup process prior beginning actual search algorithm itself."}

In other words, when a user makes his/her request, the webservice must return a list of recommended movies within seconds after receiving the request. Your web-based app should have three major components:\n* A front-end interface for users to enter requests via HTTP GET method. This interface could be implemented by HTML forms and Javascript.\n* An API server component which accepts incoming requests over HTTPS protocols. It generates queries against the DBMS according to the received data.\n* A backend DBMS component which stores all relevant information about each movie and allows the API server to access them through SQL commands.\n\nThe main functionality of this project involves implementing the following features:\n1. User login page where they are allowed to register new accounts if not already registered. Registered users may also change passwords at any given time. Once logged into the website, the user has two options available: either searching for specific titles by typing its name into the search bar OR browsing different categories such as \"Action\", \"Drama\" etcetera until finding one he likes best then clicking on it so that another window opens up displaying details regarding what type(s) belong under said category along with links leading directly back here again later down line should something else catch our eye while we're still exploring around!\n2. Whenever someone searches for certain types among these genres listed above there exists both positive & negative reviews written out explicitly stating whether or not people liked watching those particular kinds themselves personally speaking thus giving us some insight beforehand knowing exactly how much fun everyone might actually enjoy spending hours upon hours bingeing away inside bedrooms alone reading books instead since nobody really wants company anymore anyway right? Well except maybe me sometimes...but I digress..\n\n#### Part C - Database Design Document\nCreate a document describing the schema design decisions made throughout building the database. Be sure to include screenshots of the relational model created in ER Diagrammer. Your document needs to address the following topics:\n1. Explain why each entity was chosen to represent the data needed for the movie recommendation"}

They want you to build a web app where they enter all of their transactions into the database using a form. Whenever they submit one, it gets added to the table automatically. Each transaction has four fields - description, amount, date, type which could either be \u2018expense\u2019 or \u2018income.\u2019 Once submitted, they are able to see how much money they spent/earned so far over time. Your goal here would be to create an application with these features but make sure your code does not repeat itself too often because repetition makes things hard to maintain later down the road when changes happen frequently due to user feedback etc..\nThe requirements include:\n- A form where clients will add details about every transaction made throughout the day including its date; total cost ($), whether it was income or outgoing from bank account balance at any given point during weekdays & Saturday's respectively if applicable since Sunday doesn't count towards working days anymore thanks legislation passed last year!\n- An API endpoint where other applications may call upon our service whenever necessary e g retrieving information related specifically just recently completed tasks such us \"show me all my purchases between today until yesterday\" sorta thingy?

A table consists of rows called records containing columns of data called fields. Each field contains some type of value such as numbers, strings, dates etc..\n\n## 3 - Which command will help me understand how many columns exist in each table?    \nThe answer depends on your DBMS but in PostgreSQL there're two commands to achieve this purpose. `show create table` will show all columns inside the selected table while `describe <table>` will describe one specific table.\n\n## 4 - Why am I getting \"ERROR: relation does not exist\"?      \nYou are probably missing the proper schema selection or invalid table selection. If using a different DBMS then make sure to check out its documentation first before trying anything else.\n\n## 5 - What's the difference between a table and a view?     \nA table is a collection of related values stored under a unique key. This means that every row must have a unique combination of columns specified by those keys. In contrast views don\u2019t store any actual data\u2014they simply display certain subsets of other objects within your database management system (DBMS). Views allow us to manipulate our existing tables easily so we can get exactly what we want instead having them return everything at once resulting in unwanted noise being displayed back into our application codebase later down the road if left unchecked during development timeframes due mainly because no one wants unnecessary clutter clogging up things unnecessarily anyway right?\n\n#\n# Notes & Resources: \n* [Postgres Tutorial](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/)"}

Movie Recommendation System - Part II\nNow you have been given an opportunity to improve your previous solution by making it more efficient in terms of time complexity. Your improvement must not change any of the features of your query from last assignment.\nYou are allowed to use additional tables if necessary but they cannot contain data about movies already. You may also add new columns into existing tables if needed.\nImprove your previous query so that its running time will remain O(N).\nHint: Use the information provided in the class notes on DFS (depth-first search), BFS (breadth first search) and iterative depth-limited search.\n\n### 3. Top K Movies\nGiven a list of ratings and a threshold value k, we want to find top k most rated titles among them. For example, suppose our user rating table contains these entries:\n| Title | Rating | User ID | Time |\n|-------|--------|----------|------|\n| 1     |  8    |        A |     0 |\n| 2     |  7    |        A |     0 |\n| 3     |  6    |        B |     0 |\n| 4     |  5    |        C |     0 |\n| 5     |  4    |        E |     0 |\n| 6     |  3    |        F |     0 |\n| 7     |  2    |        G |     0 |\n| 8     |  1    |        H |     0 |\nWe set the threshold value to k = 3 because three items out of eight satisfy the requirement. Then the result would look something like this:\n| Title | Rating | User ID | Time |\n|-------|--------|----------|------|\n| 1     |  8    |        A |     0 |\n| 2     |  7    |        A |     0 |\n| 3     |  6    |        B |     0 |\n| 4     |  5    |        C |     0 |\nWrite a"}

Now in this exercise we want you to implement a full movie recommender system using Python programming language. This means you will have to design a class hierarchy model of the entire process from the moment when new data arrives until finalizing the list of recommended movies. In other words, your code has to take care of everything including preprocessing, feature extraction, classification etc...\n\nThe data set contains over 1 million ratings (both positive & negative). It also includes information about actors who worked together and are considered friends as well as awards won by each actor/director pair. For example if two people worked together they may share common interests thus increasing chances for them to like similar movies too. So this could mean that one person might give higher rating than another because he liked both those films but still thought highly enough about his friend so gave him more points even though overall rating was low compared against others. Another thing worth mentioning here would be how sometimes certain types of movies tend towards being reviewed negatively whereas some get praised no matter what type they happen upon; these factors must always remain top priority during development stages since otherwise there wouldn\u2019t exist any point behind building anything at first place!\n\nAim of this assignment: Write a program where user inputs his favorite genre(s), number of stars per film and maximum amount allowed before displaying list containing best possible matches according to criteria provided above along side details such as cast members involved within production team itself along side director(s)/writer(s)!"}

This means, if there were two users who each rated different places, your algorithm would not consider them equally likely as they have differing tastes. However, since both users liked the same place, then we do give more weight to that restaurant than others.\nThis application has been tested using the data found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-dataset/data\n\nThe table yelp_restaurants contains information about individual business locations such as name, address etc.\n\nThere is also another table called reviews containing information about user reviews.\n\nThe problem statement says \"given user ratings\" so you must assume all reviewers have at least one rating.\n\nYou may use other databases besides MySQL but I highly encourage you to stick with what was provided for simplicity sake.\n\n### Task #3 - Movie Genre Prediction Model\n\nGiven the genre column for every movie in IMDB, create a model to predict whether a new movie belongs to a particular genre. Your prediction needs to take into account the entire dataset, i.e., the training set does NOT include the test set. In addition, your predictions need to be ranked according to how confident you feel about its accuracy. For example, if the top prediction matches the ground truth value exactly, then assign it a confidence score of 1; otherwise assign lower scores accordingly. Finally, rank these predicted values from highest confidence downward until no further improvements can be made. Note that the ranking criteria used above assumes equal importance between precision & recall metrics (i.e., both matter); however, depending upon your approach you might find some approaches perform better under certain circumstances while others work best when applied differently elsewhere."}

Now we will take what you learned in part one and create an algorithmic solution by implementing a recommender engine which predicts new movies to watch based on user inputs and preference history. To do so, implement two functions: `predict()` which accepts three arguments: (a) a list of recommended movies, (b) a set of user preferences, and (c) a rating for each movie between 0-10. This function returns a predicted score for each item in the recommended movies list. And secondly, `rank()` which takes four arguments: (a) a list of ratings for items (movies), (b) a list of user preferences, (c) a threshold value for how many movies are allowed in the top N rankings, and finally (d) a ranking type (\u201ctop\u201d indicates that all the movies above the threshold will appear in the top rankings).\n\n**Note**: Your code must support both \u201ctop\u201d and \u201crecent\u201d. If you implemented a different approach then please explain why!\n```python\ndef predict(recs, prefs, scores): #returns a prediction vector y where y[i] is the probability that recs[i] belongs to the top ranked movies\n    if len(scores)!= len(prefs): raise ValueError(\"Must pass same length lists\")\n    \n    # Compute dot product between vectors\n    sum_product = 0\n    for i in range(len(recs)):\n        sum_product += prefs[i]*scores[i];\n        \n    return np.divide(sum_product, len(precs))*np.ones((len(recs)))  \n    \ndef rank(rec_list, prefs, thresh=None, type='top'):\n    '''Returns the list of top rated movies'''\n    if not type == \"top\" & not type==\"recent\":\n      print('Invalid"}

Your program must use a function called `getRecomMovie()` which takes two arguments, one being the user's input string and another containing the list of all movies watched by the user in the past. This method returns a sorted array of recommended movies. For example if you are given these inputs:\nInput String: \"Fight Club\"\nPast Movies Watched: [\"Blade Runner\",\"Gladiator\"]\nOutput Array: ['Kill Bill Vol. 1', 'Kill Bill Vol. 2', 'Sin City']\nYou will notice that the first three elements in the output array have a similarity score greater than 85% when compared against the input string, while Sin City has no similarities but still gets included because there were more votes cast towards it than any other non-similarity movie.  \n\nTo complete this project please make sure each file contains at least one test case where the correct answer was submitted along side its respective test case. For instance:\n```python\ndef getRecomMovie(inputString, history):\n    return sorted([movie for movie in history if getSimilarityScore(inputString,movie)>=85],key=lambda x:x[1])\ntestCases=[('Avatar',['Finding Nemo'])],[(\"Back To The Future\",[\"Indiana Jones\"])...] #and so forth...\n```"}

In this challenge you will take the same dataset as before and prepare the database by creating two new tables from the existing ones using CREATE TABLE statements. Create one table called `user` which contains all the user information and another called `recent_movies`. This second table needs to contain an entry for each film watched since they were added to the database. For example if someone watches 6 movies then there would be six entries in the recent_movies table. Finally create three more tables called `genres`, `director` and `writer`. These tables will have the fields defined below:\n\n| Table | Columns | Data Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| user | id | int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY | Primary key field used to identify unique rows within the table |\n| user | username | varchar(189) COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci DEFAULT '' NOT NULL UNIQUE | Unique identifier for the user |\n| user | email | varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci NOT NULL UNIQUE | Email address for the user |\n| user | password | longtext | Password for the user |\n| user | gender | char(1) | Gender (M/F) |\n| user | age | smallint UNSIGNED | Age group |\n| user | favoriteGenre | enum('comedy','drama','action','sci-fi','romance','adventure') | Favorite Genre |\n| user | history | text | List of movies previously watched by the user |\n| genres | tname | varchar(100) | Name of the genre |\n| director | dname | varchar(100) | Director's name |\n| writer | wname | varchar(100) | Writer's name |\n| director |"}

This time we want you to implement the entire movie recommendation system using Python programming language. Your solution must include all three steps as described below.\n\nStep #1: User Interface\n\nCreate a user interface where a user can enter his/her search parameters such as a keyword(s), genre(s), year range etc., and then submit them so they will appear in a form like shown here:\n![](images/userInterface.png)\nThe user has two options when submitting data into the user interface:\n- **Add** option allows adding new values to existing ones by clicking on + button.\n- **Remove** removes selected item(s).\n\nYou are free to choose any style for your UI but make sure it works properly. It needs to be tested before submission! Also note that you do not have to use buttons at all if there isn\u2019t enough space on screen because we don\u2019t care how exactly people click things inside our application \u2013 just ensure everything looks nice :)\n\nNote: In order to avoid confusion between different types of searches please consider naming each one differently e.g.: `keyword`,`genre`,etc.. For example: If someone wants to find out what kinda stuff does John Wayne act in he could type something along these lines : `john wayne western`. That way both keywords (`John`)and genre(`western`)will show up together under same heading instead being mixed around randomly making no sense at all :(\n\nStep #2: Data Processing Logic\nOnce submitted parameter set arrives at server side script it gets processed according to its nature i.e.: whether user asked us about finding some particular person or thing or simply wanted list items sorted alphabetically? After deciding what action shall take place next step follows immediately afterwards: loading information stored within corresponding table(s)! Depending upon given request either whole dataset containing records belonging directly related topic OR subset consisting solely those relevant entries pertaining exclusively towards requested subject matter must be"}

Movie Recommendation System - Part II\n\nIn this part of the project we will create an application using our previous work as its backend API. We are going to use Spring Boot framework in order to achieve that goal.\n\nThe user interface will consist of two parts. A search bar which receives the user\u2019s request regarding what type of movies they would like to see recommended. And then there will also be a list of suggestions generated by our API.\n![](https://github.com/Sarah-Kingston/MovieRecommenderProject/blob/master/images%20(3).png)\n\n##### Step 1 - Creating an Application Project\nOpen your terminal and navigate into the directory where you want to place all files related to your app. In my case I have created a new folder called \u201cmovie\u201d underneath the \u201cprojects\u201d folder in my home directory so let me cd over there first. Now run the command below.\n`mvn archetype:generate --interactive -DarchetypeGroupId=org.springframework.boot -DarchetypeArtifactId=spring-boot-starter-web -DgroupId=com.movies -DartifactId=movies-api -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`. This will ask us if we want to download dependencies and generate source code from examples provided within the archetypes repo. Select yes to both questions. Once finished you should now find yourself inside a brand new spring boot web application.\n![](https://github.com/Sarah-Kingston/MovieRecommenderProject/blob/master/images%20(4).png)\n\nNow open up `src\\main\\resources\\static\\index.html`, copy paste the following HTML content at the top of the file. Be sure to replace the variable values accordingly! If you don\u2019t know how to do that check out these tutorials https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQFGbUlLjIk&list=PLqgCJxYdEeXuOyPB2YAZzNMgxYiY4GcZo.\n<pre>\n<h1 class=\"text-"}

In order to make things more interesting, we are going to expand our dataset by adding two new tables namely actors and director to the existing database schema. We will also add a few additional attributes into these newly added tables such as actor_imageURLs and director_imagesURLs respectively. Your task is now to create an improved version of your previous SQL query so that it takes into account both the actor's/director's image URL and their respective ratings when generating movie recommendations to the user. Note however that we do not want any duplicate images URLs appearing within one single generated list of recommended movies since there may be multiple actors having same names. So please ensure that all duplicates have been removed before sending us back your final submission code!\n\nNew Dataset Schema & Attributes:\n1. title_actors [aconst, tconst, actorID, name, dateOfBirth, height, weight, eyeColor, hairColor, gender, ethnicity, nationality, bio, profilePictureURL]\n2. title_directors [dconst, dID, fullName, dateOfDeath, dateOfBirth, height, weight, eyeColor, hairColor, gender, ethnicity, nationality, bio, profilePictureURL]\n3. title_genre [gconst, genreID, genreName]\n\nUser Input: \nHi can you help me find a good horror comedy?\nUser Preferences History: ['Alien  (1979), Halloween   (1978)]\nSQL Query:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM title_basics INNER JOIN title_rating USING(titleID);\nINNER JOIN title_crew USING(movieID);\nLEFT OUTER JOIN title_principals ON title_principals.character = title_crew.job;\nWHERE rating >= 6.5 AND rating <= 7.0 GROUP BY character;\nORDER"}

It will test your ability to apply knowledge learned from this course to real world scenarios involving recommender systems. This is one of many problems you are expected to solve during the course, but we have chosen to include it here because it presents some unique challenges when compared to other recommended items systems such as Netflix which use collaborative filtering algorithms. In addition, unlike most of our previous exercises where you were provided with data sets containing predefined relationships between objects within those datasets, this time around there isn\u2019t any clear structure available so everything must come together organically through exploration alone! We hope these difficulties make things more interesting than usual while still being manageable enough not too overwhelming either way :) Good luck everyone!!\n#### Solution\nThis project was created using Python language along with NumPy library. For data preparation, I used Pandas DataFrame object. Then I applied machine learning algorithm KNN(k=1). Finally, I implemented Graphviz visualization tool to represent my model graphically. To get better understanding about how does work KNN algorithm please check out below link:https://medium.com/@rishabh_saxena/knn-implementation-in-python-with-illustrated-code-e7bdeffdfdba\n![](./img/image1.png)"}

This time we will use OUTER joins. For example, CROSS JOIN generates all possible combinations of rows from both tables; LEFT OUTER JOIN restricts selection to those records where there exists at least one matching row in table B; RIGHT OUTER JOIN selects all data from table A plus any unmatched rows from table B.\n\nAsk yourself what happens when you do not include distinct keywords such as GROUP BY / HAVING/ DISTINCT? What are some ways you could get around this problem?\n\nThe solution requires you to write two different queries, each having one outer join type. The first query must have a left outer join and the second query has to have a right outer join. Your solution does NOT need to return results but just show how these two types of joins work.\n\nChallenge Solution\n```sql\n-- Left Outer Join\nSELECT * FROM movies m1 \nLEFT JOIN movies m2 ON m1.title_id=m2.title_id\nORDER BY m1.title_id;\n\n-- Right Outer Join\nSELECT * FROM movies m1  \nRIGHT JOIN movies m2 ON m1.title_id=m2.title_id\nORDER BY m1.title_id;```"}

If you solve all of them, I will give an automatic +5% boost in your overall grade at the end of term.\n\n#### Part B.a - Useful Tips & Tricks\n\nIn addition to the SQL queries above, here are some useful tips/tricks which might help when generating your own SQL statements:\n* To get the number of movies per year since the start date until now using `year()` function as follows:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalMovies FROM titles GROUP BY YEAR(startDate);\n```\nThis gives me a total count of 1983 movies released from 1920-2020. This may come in handy if you want to make more complex queries later on such as recommending movies based on certain criteria like release years etc...\n\n* To find out how many movies have been rated with each given star value between 1-5 i.e., find out what percentage of films were rated **within** any specific range e.g.: `[4]` then we could use something along these lines:\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(rating) AS AverageMovieScore FROM ratings WHERE rating >= 4;\n```\nYou would just replace the variable numbers within brackets depending upon what score range you wanted to work with. For example, instead of 4 it could also be `>= 3` or even `<= 5`.\n\n* Using the same logic from before where we found out about averages across different ranges (e.g., 4), let us see how many movies had scores greater than our desired threshold? So instead of asking _how much did they rate_, lets ask _which ones scored higher_.\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM raters WHERE rating > 4 OR rating < 3 OR rating <= 5;\n```\n\n* How do I check whether there was ever an actor who appeared twice under two separate categories (job)? Easy enough actually! Just join together both table entries"}

Your task is again to generate a SQL query that can be executed on this database and the executed result should be movie recommendations to users based on their input and history of watching movies in different categories as well as what they have watched previously. Again, you don\u2019t need to show any executions or outputs but instead just the generated queries.\n\nYou might want to add more constraints than those given here since we would like to see if you know how to do so! For example, you could also enforce that there exists at least one matching row between `name_basics` table and its corresponding `title_basics`. If not then return an error message stating why such relationship does not exist which will give us insight into whether our data model design was correct before moving forward with writing code itself because otherwise there wouldn't even BE anything left after removing all invalid rows/columns etcetera..."}

You must have all your data models ready before continuing onto this section of the assignment. If not, please do so now!\n\nYou are required to use at least two new tables pertaining to the IMDb database. For example, if you decided to use the table name \"name_details\" which has the column names \"fullName\", then you would also want to include another table called \"name_pronunciations\". This way, when your application receives user inputs such as \"Saoirse Ronan\", your program could suggest other movies similar to Saoirse Ronan because her full name was included within one of the newly created tables.\n\nIn order to complete this portion successfully, you MUST implement the following steps below. Failure to follow these instructions accurately WILL lead to an immediate zero score since we cannot grade incomplete submissions due to time constraints associated with grading hundreds upon thousands of assignments each week across multiple courses during peak times throughout semesters every year here at Northeastern University where there isn\u2019t enough manpower available even though our students work extremely hard towards achieving excellence while balancing rigorous coursework demands simultaneously alongside extracurricular activities outside academia itself like sports teams etcetera\u2026\n\nStep #1 \u2013 Create New Table(s):\nCreate any number of tables needed to support your recommendation algorithm by adding them directly inside your database schema file along side \u201cschema-tables\u201d folder located under resources directory pathway provided above earlier within this document description area segmented off separately prior mentioned location point identified previously stated moments ago preceding sentence written down here right now currently being typed out currently typing away rapidly typing fastly writing quickly creating sentences forming words making phrases stringing together letters arranging words putting ideas thoughts concepts theories belief systems ideologies philosophical viewpoints perspectives points views opinions arguments debates discussions discourses dialogues conversational exchanges interpersonal communication interactions verbal communicative interactional engagements engaging participants audience members listeners readers spectators watchers observers"}

Movie Recommendation System - Part II\n\nThe above SQL query will return the top rated comedic movies from IMDB's database. However, there are many other factors you could use in order to determine which movies would best fit your preference. In addition to the user input provided by the user, you could also add the user's gender as an additional factor when generating a recommendation list of potential candidates for the next recommended film. This means that instead of just using one SQL statement, we now have two separate statements that work together to create our final product. So let us look at how these two queries interact with each other so they may both contribute towards creating our desired outcome!\n## Gender Prediction Algorithm\nWe first need to predict whether someone is male or female before being able to make any sort of recommendation because if I do not know what type of personality he/she has then I cannot suggest anything else besides random titles until after knowing more information about them through surveys etcetera...\nIn order achieve accuracy levels greater than chance alone while still having enough data points available within my dataset; however this does require some manual labor since no machine learning algorithm exists yet capable enough handling such small datasets like those found here but luckily there isn't much effort needed either way given current technological advancements today!\n\n**Given:** A person's age and occupation.\n* **Predict:** Whether they are male or female?\n***Input:*** Person's Age & Occupation ***Output:*** Male / Female\n****Sample Input:*** 29 year old lawyer ***Sample Output:*** False\n************* Sample Input:*** 29 yr old waitress   ***Sample Output True    ********\n#### Step-by-step solution:\n\nThis question was asked during the interview process.

Your application will consist of two main parts: a web front-end and a back-end. In your front-end you must implement a form that allows new reviews to be added. This includes a rating from one star through five stars as well as a textual description of what the reviewer thought about the film they viewed. When submitting these forms, the data entered into the form fields should then get saved onto the server. For each submission made via the form field, there should also be an email sent out automatically to the author informing him/her whether his/her submitted content was accepted or rejected.

It also uses flask framework which provides HTTP request handling capabilities. You are required to follow these steps while implementing your project.\n* Create a folder called \"MovieRecom\" under the directory where you have saved all your code files from previous projects. This will contain your project codebase.\n* Include all necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the new created folder named \"MovieRecom\".\n    * If you do not know how to add packages through pip then refer to [this](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) tutorial.\n* Write a file named \"main.py\", save it into \"MovieRecom\" folder and open it up.\n    * Your main.py file must include the imports for the modules used throughout the project including flask, sqlalchemy etc. For example, import requests, urllib, json, etc..\n        ```Python\n            # Imports here...\n            \n        \tfrom app import db\n                  ...\n                from flask import Flask\n                    ...\n        \timport os\n                  ...\n        ```\n* Next step would be creating a class object for the application. As we don't want our application logic within the main function itself so create another module and call its functions via __init__.py file located at root level i.e., inside \"MovieRecom\" folder. Then place the main.py file into the newly created folder \"app\" along with other supporting classes.\n* Finally, write a script to run the web server. Place this script inside \"MovieRecom\\bin\" folder. To execute this script use command line interface like below:\n```bash\n$ cd MovieRecom\n$ bin/runserver\n```\nThe above commands will launch a local development server listening on port 5000 and will show some basic information about the installed packages.\nYou can now access the web page hosted locally using any browser pointing URL http://localhost:5000/.

We are going to use our existing database for this exercise. For example we want to know all actors who have worked together on more than three films so we would run the following sql query:\n```sql\nselect distinct(actors), count(*) as numberOfFilmsWorkedOnGroup\nfrom acting_relationships ar join actor a on ar.actor = a.id\ngroup by actors having groupCount > 3 order by numberOfFilmsWorkedOnGroup desc limit 5\n```\nYou must create an SQL statement which uses at least two different types of joins between any combination of these tables: \n- Title Basics Table (title_basics)\n- Name Basic Table (name_basic)\n- Title Crew Table (title_crew)\n- Title Principal Table (title_principal)\n- Movie Rating Table (movie_rating)\n- Actor Relatedness Table (acting_relationships)\nCreate a new SQL file called \"task_9\" in your solution folder containing both the SELECT and CREATE statements necessary to complete the given task.\n### Task #10 - Using GROUP BY & HAVING clauses\nNow that you understand how to use joins properly, let's take another look at our favorite database and see what else we can do! In particular we want to find out how many times each director has directed someone else during their career? To accomplish this goal we first select all possible combinations between people who work together then filter down until there are no remaining duplicates before counting up how often they occurred across all possible matches within each film's cast list/director etc.. This process involves grouping everything together under certain criteria such as gender/age range while keeping track of total counts through various filtering methods including `Having` clause(s).\nTo complete this task, write a SQL script that returns the following information grouped by Director ID and Genre.\n```\nDirectorID | Count(Genre)\n--------------------------\n1         |  2\n2         |  1\n3         |  0\n```\nThe output above shows that director John Waters had the most films in his genre Horror Movies followed closely"}

Your first step in building such an application will be creating a model that takes user ratings as inputs and returns scores of recommended items given those ratings. A score represents how much two entities are similar to each other. This score should take into account both commonalities between these entities but also differences so that highly rated films do not always receive high scores from others who liked them too. For example if we were trying to predict what someone would rate another film they gave five stars then perhaps there isn't anything special about this particular one since many people give five star ratings anyway! However suppose instead we want our algorithm find out whether someone might like watching something new because they didn't know anything else existed besides what was already available at Netflix? In order achieve success here you must consider all possible combinations when generating predictions even though most won\u2019t actually happen due random chance alone being responsible enough themselves! Now let us assume that after training up some machine learning models against past data points found within said databases wherein every person had access along side whatever information came next during testing periods involving real world scenarios outside lab environments etc., everything worked well overall except maybe sometimes making mistakes occasionally resulting either false positives/negatives occurring randomly throughout process itself.....but still ultimately leading towards greater accuracy rates over time!!\n\n**Note :** You may use any programming language you wish to build your solution. We suggest Python however feel free to choose whichever suits best according availability resources etcetera...\n\n#### Task II - Implement the same recommendation system online using the Amazon Product Review Dataset.\nNow lets say instead of working with just one company whose customers leave reviews behind whenever purchasing products through ecommerce websites etc..., now imagine having millions upon billions worth consumers across entire globe leaving feedbacks regarding various goods & services bought everywhere around planet earth including those located underground inside caves full darkness deep below sea level somewhere far away ocean surface! How cool sounds right??? Well don't worry cause thanks modern technology advancements today allows exactly doing"}

This site has user reviews of movies and TV series along with ratings in terms of percentage out of 100. Your task is to create two new tables titled \u201cuserReview\u201d which will contain information about each individual review and also another table called \u201creviewAggregator\u201d. In this table you want to aggregate all user\u2019s reviews into one big table by grouping them according to the year they were released.\n\n**Note:** The files have been named as follows: **`MovieReviewsDatabase.sqlite`, `moviereviews-users.csv`, `movierereviews-years.csv`. These files must remain untouched until your submission!**\n\n### Task 004 - Predicting User Satisfaction From Features\nIn this exercise we'll predict whether or not a customer is likely to purchase something online using machine learning techniques. We use a dataset consisting of customers who bought something at Amazon.com between January 2008 and March 2009. Each row corresponds to one transaction; there are 1.6 million rows total.\n\n#### Instructions\n1. Import these three datasets into RStudio Jupyter Notebook environment.\n    + [Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/threejs-examples/master/data/amazon-transactions.json),\n    + [Data Dictionary](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/amazon+transaction+dataset+(1+million)),\n    + [Column Headers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/threejs-examples/master/data/columnheaders.txt).\n\n2. Run the code below in order to get familiarized with our dataset.\n   ```python\n     import pandas as pd\n     \n     df = pd.read_csv('amazon_transactions.csv')\n     \n     print(\"Total transactions:\", len(df))\n     \n     # Check if any transaction was made more than once per day\n     print(\"Number of unique dates: \", df[\"date"}

This will give you the following output:\n`x : 0, 1, 2,..., N-1.`\n\n### 6 - 20 points\nCreate an object called Movie in class MovieDatabase with attributes:\n1. id: integer\n2. title: string\n3. year: int\n4. actors: list of Actors objects\n5. director: Director object\n6. writer: Writer object\n7. producer: Producer object\n8. genres: list of Genres objects\n9. language: Language object\n10. plotKeywords: set of strings\n\nYou may also create methods such as getActors(), getDirector() etc.\n\n### 7 - 20 points\nImplement a function called findMovieByGenreId which takes one parameter, the ID number of the desired genre. It returns a Movie object containing information about any films within the specified genre. Your method must return either null or an empty list when no matching film exists."}

In this exercise we are going to ask you to implement three different aggregation functions. We want you to use these same functions as in your previous assignment but now instead of writing them in Python they must be written in SQL.\n\nTo help you out here is a list of what each function does.\n* COUNT() returns the number of distinct rows returned by the select statement.\n* SUM() adds up all numbers contained within the column specified into one value. For example if there was two movies and both had ratings = 8 then the rating would equal to 16.\n* AVG() averages every row's rating together and calculates an average score between everything. So if there were five movies and four rated 7 and one rated 5 then the average would come out to be 6.0 because it divided 15/5.\nYou may assume that the data type for each field is either int or float depending on how many digits after decimal point.\n\nCreate separate queries for each function and submit those separately along with instructions explaining what the query does. This means that when submitting your code make sure not to put multiple queries inside a single file otherwise your work won\u2019t get graded properly. If possible please include comments describing why certain things have been done. Also feel free to explain anything else about your solution that might be confusing so that someone reading over your submission understands better what exactly happened during execution time! Lastly don't forget our standard formatting rules; no spaces before semicolons or commas at beginning lines etc... Good luck everyone!!"}

Cleaning Data - Using MySQL\n\nThe goal of cleaning data in databases is to make sure you have consistent and accurate information stored there. Incorrect information might cause unexpected behavior when processing your queries. This project will focus on removing duplicate entries from a table.\n\nIn order to do so, we are going to use the `DISTINCT` function within our SELECT statement. For example, if you wanted to remove all duplicates from a table containing two columns named \"name\" and \"age\", then you would write something similar to the following code:\n\n```mysql\nSELECT DISTINCT name, age FROM mytable;\n```\n\nHowever, instead of using just one column at a time as shown above, what happens if we want to select multiple columns? What about selecting all three columns together into a single row? Well, luckily enough, MySQL provides us with an easy way around these problems by allowing us access directly through its `GROUP BY` clause! Let me show you how...\n\nSuppose we had a table called people which contained four fields: id number, first name, last name, and gender (male/ female). We could easily get rid of any redundant rows by running the following command:\n\n```mysql\nSELECT distinct p.first_name + \", \" + p.last_name AS full_name, p.gender FROM people AS p GROUP BY p.full_name ORDER BY p.gender ASC LIMIT 10;\n```\n\nNote here that we used both `distinct` _and_ `group by`. Without either one of them working correctly alone wouldn\u2019t produce useful results because they each rely heavily upon having corresponding values being returned back during executions\u2014so even though both commands were present inside our overall statement structure beforehand neither was able effectively perform its respective duty unless another piece came along later down line too help complete things properly afterwards after everything else got sorted out already done previously anyway..\n\nNow let\u2019s say instead we didn\u2019t know exactly where those pesky duplicates originated from nor did we care much about figuring out why certain ones existed either\u2026well then maybe adding another field onto top would work better suited towards helping solve such issues altogether since now instead"}

This course does not cover machine learning in depth so we are going to focus on some of its most popular algorithms such as KNN and SVM.\n\nYou must first create an account at http://www.imdb.com/user/urllist where you'll find all the data used throughout the projects from this class.\n\nOnce you have created your account go to http://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=tt_ov_rt and look up any two films which are similar but different enough. Copy down both titles into the console below. For example if I wanted to compare 'The Dark Knight Rises' against another film then I might choose 'Batman Begins'. Your challenge today is to write code that finds the distance between these two films according to the IMDB similarity index. As before, use the Python programming language and the SciKitLearn library.\n\nNow let us take a step back and think how we could solve our problem more efficiently by creating a new algorithm instead of relying on manual calculations. We want to compute distances automatically so what do we need? Well we need a way to represent each film, possibly even every other element stored within the dataset! It turns out that there are many ways to represent information however one very common method is called \"feature engineering\". Feature Engineering allows us to transform raw information into something much easier to work with. In our case we may decide to store the year of release for each film along with the length of time they were released. Other features include the number of actors involved in production etc... After doing feature engineering we now have a representation of each film that has been encoded into numbers. Now that we have numerical representations of each film we simply perform a calculation over them to get a distance value representing the similarity between two given items.\n\nWe also learned about clustering techniques earlier in this semester during lecture #7. Clusters allow us to group together related objects while keeping unrelated ones apart from each other. Our goal here is simple; we wish to cluster together those films who share similarities whilst separating dissimilar films far away"}

Movie Database Project - Part II ##\n\n#### Tasks ####\n\nTask #1: Create a new table called `movies` in your database schema which contains all of the information from the `titles`, `ratings`, `name_basics`, and `cast_members`. Then create an INSERT statement using your newly created movies table as well as some data you will find online. For example, you could use the `http://www.imdb.com/find?q=Movies+in+theatres&refine=&release-date[]=2016&genre[]=Action%2C+Drama&sort=-releaseDate,-year&page=1` URL. This request returns JSON data about movies currently playing at US cinemas. Try inserting these movies into the `movies` table.\n\nTask #2: Write a SELECT statement that lists out every movie currently available on Netflix along with its release date, genre(s), director, writer, actors etc.. Include any other fields you think are important but make sure not to include anything that isn\u2019t listed by Netflix when they return search results. Note: We do not want just one row per film because there may exist multiple entries if someone searches for different variations such as \u201cBridget Jones Diary\u201d vs Bridget Jone\u2019s Diary\u201d. Instead try listing each entry individually within one large SELECT statement so we get many rows returned instead of one big long list like before!"}

Your task is to write code to match each comment to its corresponding title using the LIKE operator as follows:\n\nInput: Comments containing words such as \"good\", \"great\", etc., are more likely related to positive ratings than negative ones.\nInput: User submitted review: I love horror films!\nOutput: This is most likely referring to the horror film \u201cBlair witch project\u201d since they both contain similar keywords.\n\n**Hint:** You will have access to a dictionary mapping all unique terms found within comments to their respective titles. To obtain these dictionaries use the `DICTIONARY()` function from our library.\n\nYou may assume the dictionary is sorted by frequency. For example, if you were looking up the term \u2018horror\u2019 then you would get back every instance where the word was used along with the associated title id.\n\nWrite your solution so that it takes two parameters \u2013 the first parameter being the list of comments and the second being the dictionary mentioned above. It must return a list of pairs consisting of the comment ID and the matching title ID. Each pair needs to be separated by commas e.g.: `[(commentID1), (titleID1)]`"}

Your application must include at least one line chart. For example, if we have two colors \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cRed\u201d, then our application should show us which other colors are close enough to these two colors so that they could be considered similar. This means that there has to exist some distance metric between any pair of colors used in the app. We suggest using Euclidean Distance but feel free to choose whatever works best for you!\n\nUser Input: \nMy favorite color is blue, my disliked color is red\nUser Preferences: \n[blue,red]\nSQL Query:\nSelect * from (select distinct tcolor from tablecolors where tcolor IN ('blue','green','yellow','purple'));\n\n### Problem #9 - Data Mining Techniques\n\n#### Task Description\n\nIn this problem set, you will learn about different machine learning techniques such as clustering algorithms and regression models. These methods are very important because they allow us not just to analyze large amounts of data efficiently but also predict future outcomes based on past ones. In order to do this effectively though; firstly we need access to some real world datasets containing both structured information (e.g., numerical values) along with unstructured textual content describing each item within them. Once collected into databases like MySQL Server Database Management System (DBMS), we can begin exploring ways through which various patterns might emerge across multiple variables including things like gender identity classification accuracy rates over time periods ranging anywhere from weeks up until months long intervals depending upon what type of modeling approach was chosen initially during training phase before deployment onto production"}

This project was created during one of our workshops where we used SQL to build a simple web app. We encourage you to follow along with us! \ud83d\ude80\n\nYou are given access to a public API endpoint hosted at https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-finder. The API returns information about color schemes including hex values. The data returned includes all colors available within each scheme which allows you to create a list of options when selecting a new paint color.\nTo complete this challenge you must first obtain some sample data from the above URL into a table called `colors`. Once obtained, add another column titled \"scheme\" so that every row has its own unique ID associated with it. Next, use these IDs to join back onto themselves via GROUP BY statements before joining again through UNION ALL commands. Finally, order everything according to descending number of votes per group then return them all together inside a single SELECT statement.\n\n**Sample Outputs:**\n```sql\n+----+-------+----------+-----------------------------+------+---------+\n| id | hex   | rgb     | lightness              | r      | g       | b    |\n+----+-------+----------+-----------------------------+------+---------+\n|  1 | #DCDC9F | rgba(...,...)|...                    |        |         |\n|  2 | #EAEBFD | rgba(...),...|...                    |        |         |\n|  3 | #FAFBFC | rgba(...)     |...                    |        |         |\n...\n```\n#### Sample Data:\n```json\n[{\"id\": \"1\", \"hex\":\"#dcdc9f\",\"rgb\":\"rgba(\", \"lightness\":\"...)\", \"r\": \"...\", \"g\":...\"\", \"b\": \"\"}, {\"id\": \"2\", \"hex\":\"#eaeabfd"}

Movie Recommendation System - Part II ###\nThis question will take part two of your project. In order to complete the second half of your assignment, we require that you create an API using Python Flask as well as implement some basic data structures such as Queues, Linked Lists, Stacks etc. Please refer back to the video tutorial provided in week four to help guide you through these steps. Your submission must include both the code used to run your application locally and a link to the deployed version of your app hosted online.\n\nYou may use any programming language but if you decide to go down the Python route, feel free to utilize flask-restful module which provides support for REST APIs. If you are new to Python then check out our Introduction To Python Tutorial Series before proceeding further.\n\nOnce again, there'll be no point submitting your work unless you also submit a sample request payload and response along with the URL where your app has been deployed. The endpoint you wish to test would ideally have something like `/movieRecom/recs?title=<name>&genre=&year=&rating=&age=&gender=&id=` so make sure you set up one accordingly when implementing your solution. This means you should write at least three different types of queries depending upon whether user inputs `name`,`year`,`genre`,etc., respectively while making requests via POST method against given URLs from postman tool mentioned earlier during Week Three Assignment Submission Period. All requests sent by client side should contain JSON formatted body containing key value pairs representing parameters required by respective endpoints defined above i.e., `title`, `year`, `genre`.\n\n### 7. Data Structures & Algorithms ###\nAs per my previous experience working on projects involving big data sets, I believe understanding how data flows through systems requires knowledge about various fundamental concepts related to algorithms and data structures first hand rather than just relying solely on textbooks alone because sometimes things don\u2019t always happen exactly according what book says them too do.. For example say someone asks me why does sorting takes O(N log N)? My answer might sound simple enough \u201cbecause each element needs access every other item once until sorted\u201d. But actually speaking behind scenes algorithmic complexity calculations involve taking"}

This way, whenever someone watches some film, we just update that row in our main table(titles).\nThen, whenever anyone gives request for recommending movies, we simply fetch records whose `averageRatng>6` and then filter them out based on whether they belong to same genre as requested one OR not.\n\n```sql\nUPDATE titles SET user_id =?

Create an application that displays the list of movies in your collection by using the IMDB API. Your application will have two pages - Home page and Movies page. On homepage you want to display the top rated movies from the list of all the movies available at the moment. For example, if there are five hundred thousand movies then show ten random ones. This information needs to come from the imdb api call. On the second page, when user clicks on any one of those movies they get redirected to details about that particular film which also includes actors involved in making that film along with other related info such as genre etc...\n\n### 9. Implement a web app that allows users to create accounts where they store reviews for different types of products including books, movies, restaurants etc\u2026 Each review has four main fields \u2013 rating out of 10 stars given to each product being reviewed followed by text description explaining why someone gave certain ratings e.g., \u201cThis book was amazing because I learned so much new stuff\u201d OR \u201cThe food here sucks\u201d. Users may choose whether they would like others who visit site after them see these comments publicly displayed underneath specific items listed within respective categories OR privately visible only upon clicking onto individual item itself via dropdown menu provided next post form submission button located near bottom right hand corner screen\u2019s layout area..\n\n### 10. Write code that generates a set of random numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive. Use this function repeatedly until it produces a number less than.5, then stop generating random values. If possible use more than just one line of code to accomplish this goal!"}

Now we are going to take things up a notch by joining multiple table sources into our final SELECT statement!\n\nIn part A you used two different tables from the same source (`tblMovie`). In this challenge however, you will use three separate databases but still get them to work together within a single select statement.\n\nThe new databases you have access to are `tblActors`, `tblDirector`, and `tblGenre`. Your goal is to create an overall score for each actor/director combination where they have acted together and then return the top five scores per director. To do so, you must first figure out how to link these tables together via a common column value between the three. For example if you wanted to combine the `tblGenre` data with both `tblMovie` & `tblActor` what would that look like? Let\u2019s find out\u2026\n\nAs mentioned above, there are four tables available for your use. These are listed below along with any other information about those tables. It might also help to refer back to the schema diagram at the bottom of the page which shows how these tables relate to one another.\n\n| Table Name | Column Names   | Description                              |\n|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| tblGenre    | genre           | A list of genres associated with films |\n| tblDirector | lastname        | Listing of names belonging to directors |\n| tblActor    | firstname       | Listing of names belonging to actors     |\n| tblMovie    | titleid         | Unique identifier for every film        |\n\n#### Part B Instructions\n**Step One:** Identify the relationships between the various tables. This means identifying which values from one table match values from other tables. In order to do this you may want to review the schema diagrams located at the very bottom of this document before attempting this step.\n\nOnce you identify"}

Your webpage must contain the following elements:\n* A form element allowing the user to enter his/her preference history as a comma-separated list of strings. For example, if we want to get recommendations for \"Moneyball\" then we would have the string \"'Moneyball'\". This parameter MUST NOT BE NULLABLE! If there are no values entered by the user, the script must not execute any queries; instead, show a message explaining what needs to be done next.\n* An option to see all recommendations returned by the query(s). The recommendation table should include at least two rows per each user requesting them. One row shows the top recommended item, while another one displays all other items ordered according to how well they match with the given preference criteria. We assume here that every movie has its own rating which means we cannot use just simple sorting algorithms such as bubble sort because some ratings may differ greatly between different titles e.g., one could rate Blade Runner higher than Moneyball but still find both equally interesting films so sorting alphabetically doesn\u2019t really work either since \u201cB\u201d comes before \u201cA\u201d. So instead let us calculate similarity scores between each pair of possible matches using cosine distance formula which takes into account whether two terms occur together often enough during training phase when creating model parameters etc...\n### Hints\nYou don't need to implement all features mentioned above. Just focus on building up basic functionality first before adding more complex stuff later down road once you understand everything better yourself :)"}

This will store data about products in warehouses along with details of sales and purchases. A product has many attributes which are stored as separate fields in different tables. There are three main types of tables; `product`, `warehouse` and `transaction`. All transactions take place between two locations i.e., a location where stock was purchased from (`supplier`) and another one where it was sold at (`customer`). The transaction table stores the information regarding these transactions whereas the other two tables have more detailed records about each individual product/location respectively. Your task is to create all necessary tables using CREATE TABLE statements followed by INSERT INTO queries specifying sample values. Finally you must execute your entire script including any additional commands such as DROP TABLE etcetera before submitting it online via Gradescope.\nYou may find useful resources here: https://www.gradescope.com/help/how-do-i-create-an-inventory-system-database-using-mysql/\n### Task #3 - Creating a Movie Recommendation System Using MySQL\nThis assignment requires students to use the IMDb database provided above and write code that generates personalized movie suggestions given some basic parameters entered by a user e.g., genre preference(s), age range restriction if applicable etc.. For example: If someone enters \"Action\" into his/her favorite genre field then he would receive recommended action flicks like Transformers & Terminator while those who don't care much about specific categories get random selections across multiple genres (horror included)."}

For example if we want sum up total amount sold per month then just add up all numbers present within fact table\u2019s Month column & divide them by number of days between first day&last day of given month because there were no records available before starting date so we must exclude those dates while calculating sum otherwise our final result wouldn't represent true picture since some items weren't included due lack info regarding its availability prior beginning point.

In addition to what has been covered so far, you are required to implement the following functionality:\n- **Subquery** : A subquery returns an intermediate value from another SELECT statement inside its own SELECT statement. To achieve this, we will use the \"SELECT\" keyword followed by the table name then parentheses around our subselect expression within which we can reference fields from other tables. For example:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM titles WHERE rating > (SELECT avg(rating) FROM ratings);\n```\nThis type of subquery is called aggregate subquery because it selects aggregated values like sum() and count().\n- **Join/Aggregation** : Join is used when two different tables contain information about each other but they do not share any common key between them; instead, join uses foreign keys to link these tables together into one dataset where all rows have corresponding records across both tables. An important thing here would be using proper JOIN syntax along with GROUP BY clauses if needed otherwise there could be duplicate entries returned back due to no unique identifier present among those joined datasets!\nYou may also want to consider adding ORDER BY clauses after grouping operations since multiple groups might produce similar outputs depending upon how many times certain items appear throughout various subsets (e.g., age range). Finally remember always check whether everything looks correct before submitting anything else just in case something went wrong during development process :)"}

This makes data retrieval faster since queries will not have to search through all of the rows from one large table but instead just those contained within each partition. It also reduces storage space because fewer rows means less disk usage per row. However, there must always exist at least one partition containing every record from any given table; otherwise an error would occur when attempting to access records outside its range. In addition, if two or more tables share common fields then these cannot be used together unless both sets contain exactly equal numbers of entries across them due to how indexing works internally by creating separate indices for each column type present inside each respective structure's schema definition file(s). So while using partitioned databases does indeed make sense under certain circumstances where lots of small pieces add up quickly over time compared against larger amounts being stored elsewhere simultaneously anyway \u2013 especially during peak periods such as holidays etc., sometimes having everything located somewhere else altogether may actually prove advantageous depending upon what kinda stuff needs doing first before anything else happens next afterwards.....\n\nThis assignment requires students to use the MySQL Workbench GUI tool provided by Oracle Corporation. It provides graphical interfaces similar to Microsoft Access\u2019 frontend but offers additional features such as support for multiple databases connected via ODBC drivers along with various other advanced functions including full text searching capabilities among many others things besides merely importing/exporting files between computers running Windows operating systems either locally or remotely online anywhere around globe wide web network connections available today worldwide everywhere all times day night weekends vacation breaks whatever whenever however wherever whomever whoever whyever anyone ever wants knows finds out discovers learns understands realizes appreciates comprehends recognizes sees hears feels touches smells tastes senses perceives experiences observes notes writes down documents keeps track counts measures calculates adds subtracts multiplies divides percentages fractions decimals roots exponents logarithms trigonometric identities sine cosine tangent cotangent secant cosecant arcsec arccsc inverse hyperbolic exponential"}

Your app will take two inputs from the user -- one being the movie ID which can be found by searching the movie in imdb-moviedatabase.csv file under the column titled `imdbID`. The other input would be the number of stars you want your review system to consider when generating its score out of five possible stars. For example if a user wants four star ratings then he/she needs to enter 4 as his second parameter. After receiving these inputs from the user, your program must return a string containing the textual description of how many stars are given to the specific movie along with some explanation about why those particular stars were chosen. Here's what your program must do:\n* Take any movie id entered into the system\n* Search through the CSV files and find all rows where the value in the column named `movie` matches the movie id provided by the user. If there isn't anything returned after performing this search operation then display error message saying so. Otherwise continue onto next step\n* Find all rows whose values fall within range specified by user during initializing phase i.e., between zero & maxStars inclusive\n* Add up total amount of votes casted per row found earlier\n* Divide sum obtained above by total count of votes available across entire table\n* Round off final fractional part away towards negative infinity leaving behind whole numbers only! This way we get rid of decimal places which might cause confusion later down line while displaying scores back again\n**Output Example #1 :**\n\n![](./images/outputExample1.png)\n\n**Output Example #2 :**\n\n![](./images/outputExample2.png)"}

Database Normalization & De-Normalizing\n\nThe above query will not work because of de-normalized data in table #1.\n\nDe-Normalize your data so you are able to run the previous query successfully.\nYou must use all of the tables available from the IMDb database.\nNote: We do NOT expect you to know how to normalize/de-normalize databases but we want you to understand what normalization means. \nWe also don't expect you to write any code here but just explain clearly why certain steps were taken when performing these tasks.\n\n### 4. Data Mining & Machine Learning\n\nMachine learning techniques such as clustering algorithms are used to identify groups within the dataset where there may exist similarities between items. For example, clustering may help us find similar titles based on common actors who have starred in multiple films together. This would allow us to group those titles into clusters which could then serve as recommended titles given user preference history and current search criteria entered by the user at time of requesting recommendations.\n\nIn addition, machine learning models such as neural networks could be trained using features extracted through dimensionality reduction methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis), followed by classification techniques applied over top of each cluster created via clustering algorithm(s). Once these classifications occur they become predictions about future behaviors related specifically towards item selection decisions made while browsing content online - i.e., \"what type\" or genre does one typically gravitate toward most often? These predicted outcomes derived from training sets provided during initial phase before deployment onto production servers represent highly accurate estimates which enable companies providing internet services worldwide deliver personalized experiences tailored precisely according individual needs wants desires tastes etc.."}

Each loop must use one variable inside another variable. For example, you may have an outer loop `for` statement where each iteration uses a different inner value. This means there could potentially be multiple values used by the same number of iterations. In addition, we also allow you to declare variables at any point during execution of code if they don\u2019t exist already (but not before). If necessary, these new declarations will replace old ones instead of creating duplicate names! Please note however that all declared variables still remain valid even after being replaced due to scope rules governing how functions work together when calling themselves back-to-back\u2014this includes both local scopes defined outside main() itself along with global ones found elsewhere throughout our project files too!.\n\nUser Input: \nIt likes horror films such as The Ring(2002), but I hate scary stuff so please don't suggest anything else than romantic comedies :)\nUser Preferences History: \n['Hitch (2005)', 'My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)]\nPython Script:\n```python\nimport sys # Importing standard library module called \"sys\" which contains many useful tools including print().\nfrom random import randint # Imports random function to get random numbers between 0 & 1 inclusive.\n\nmovie = [] # Declares empty list called \"movies\".\nuser_input = str(input(\"Please enter what type of genre do u enjoy? : \\n\"))\ngenre=[]\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        genre +=[user_input]\n        \n    except ValueError:\n       print (\"Invalid Genre\")\n       break\n    \nuser_preferances=[str(randint(0, len(genre))+1)+\" \"+genre[randint(0,len(genre)-1)]+\"\\n\"]\nwith open('./data/test"}

Your code must validate each parameter before passing them into the SQL statement so that no errors are thrown when any of these inputs aren\u2019t validated correctly. If there isn\u2019t enough information provided by the user then nothing will return back because they haven\u2019t supplied everything needed to get data out of our database using advanced searching techniques like full text search capabilities etc.. This part needs two methods: one method should take care about validation process & another method should handle actual execution against DBMS itself which means performing operations such as selecting records according specified criteria set up earlier during initialisation phase where we define what kinda queries would go through here e g if u want select every row containing \"Julia Roberts\" somewhere inside its content field then just pass variable `name` value = `\"Julia Roberts\"` along w other required fields like type/category etc\u2026\n### Part C - Create new record in Movie Database\nYou have been asked by your boss at work to create some new records within his company's databases since he has received many requests lately due lack time resources available right now but still wants things done properly even though nobody else seems willing do anything helpful around office area anymore either! So let us help him solve problem once again while helping ourselves too ;) Nowadays everyone knows how important maintaining accurate information becomes over time especially when dealing large amounts people working together towards same goal...\n\n### Part D - Update existing Record in Movie Database\nNow that I know how easy was updating existing entries via MySQL command line tool(MariaDB),I decided give myself challenge update multiple items simultaneously instead doing each separately manually.This way saving lots precious minutes per day spent running updates individually until now :)"}

To do so first create an empty table called \"imdb\" using the command below. This creates a new table named imdb which has no rows yet.\n\n```python\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\nengine = sa.create_engine('sqlite:///imdb.db') # Create engine object from sqlite db file\n```\n\nNext import all the tables into the database using the `sa.Table()` function along with the names given by us earlier. We are also importing two functions namely `insert_many` and `select`. These functions insert many records at once and select one record respectively.\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Integer, String\ntables= {'title_basic':Table('title_basic','tconst int, titleType varchar(2), primaryTitle varchar(64), originalTitle varchar(64), isAdult bool, startYear int, endYear int, runtimeMinutes int, genres text'),\\\n'name_basic':Table('name_basic','nconst int, primaryName varchar(64), birthYear int, deathYear int, primaryProfession varchar(8), knownForTitles text'), \\\n'title_rating':Table('title_rating','averageRating float, numVotes int'), \\\n'title_crew':Table('title_crew','directors text, writers text'), \\\n'title_principal':Table('title_principal','ordering int, nconst int, category text, job text, character text')}\n```\n\nThe next step is to add movies to the database. For each row added, ensure that there are no existing entries for that particular row under any column. If such an entry exists then update the values instead of adding another duplicate row. Add 9 movies to the database using the code shown below.\n\n```python\ntitles=[{'titleType':'drama', 'originalTitle':'Blade Runner'},\n         {'titleType':'comedy',"}

Implementing a Movie Recommendation System in Python - Part II\nIn part I of this project you implemented a basic recommendation algorithm using MySQL queries but now we are going to implement an even better recommendation model by utilizing some machine learning techniques. For starters, let\u2019s begin by creating our data frame which will store all of our training information as well as the ratings given from each user. Then, we will split up our dataset into two parts; one for training purposes while another serves as testing material where new rating predictions must be made. After completing these steps successfully then comes time when everything needs refining because there may have been errors along way so make sure not overlook anything during debugging phase! Next thing would involve finding out what type(s) algorithms work best suited towards solving problem at hand here since they vary widely depending upon specific situation being faced off against competitors who might also want same solution achieved too... Finally once everything has gone according plan finally submit code back home office before moving onto next challenge ahead us waiting right around corner ready take down whatever stands between them & glory itself!! Good luck everyone :)"}

Generic Recommendation System - Part II\nYou have been asked by your manager at work to implement an improved version of the previous recommendation system using more complex algorithms such as collaborative filtering techniques. Your manager has given you two days before he wants everything working so please get started!\n\nThe new algorithm must use the same data schema from part one but will also take into account multiple user inputs and outputs in order to produce better quality recommendations. As well as implementing the algorithm itself, you are required to write documentation explaining how the algorithm works including pseudocode describing each step of the process. This document will help other developers understand what they are doing when trying out different combinations of algorithms.\n\nPlease refer back to part one if needed during development.\n\n### 79.

This means that every time someone uses our application they get different suggestions than before because their preference history changes over time due to watching other movies after using our app initially.\n\nYou must update all parts of your existing solution so far including but not limited to adding:\n* An additional feature vector per user.\n* A way to predict whether another person would also enjoy any given film based off of what they have seen previously (and maybe even some kind of confidence score too?).\n* A graphical interface where people enter information about themselves along with ratings/reviews etc... then receive personalized recommendations back later once everything has been processed properly (this could include textual descriptions or visual representations depending upon how advanced things become).\n\n### Part III - Extra Credits\n\nExtra credit available if desired :)"}

You want to create a new column called year which will contain the release date of every movie, i.e., 2010-01-01 through 2019-12-31. To do so, we will first add a Year column by using GROUP BY and then SUM() aggregation function. Then, we will join two datasets together and concatenate them into one long string.

Your app requires you to filter out all of the data from one table into another table using the `GROUP BY` functionality. However, when you execute your code, you get the error message below:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/jacob-rogers7/jacob-rogerstest/blob/master/.github/images/error.png\">\nWhat does this mean? How do we fix our code so that we don't receive such errors again? What is happening here?

Make sure you have created a schema named \"movie-recs\", then go into your terminal and run ```psql --username=postgres --dbname=\"movie-recs\"``` so you'll connect directly to your new database and not the default one which may cause problems later. Then in psql type:  \n`create table ratings(title text, avg_rating float);`   \nand press enter. Now go back to your IDE and open up the file called \"main.js\" where you will write your code. Before doing anything else import the `pg` module by typing:  \n```javascript\nimport {Client} from \"pg\"; // Importing pg\nclient = new Client({\n\tuser:\"postgres\",\n\thost:\"localhost\",\n\tdatabase:'movie-recs'\n});// Connecting to the database we just made\n```\nYou now want to create another function called \"getMovieRecommendation()\" because all of our logic is going to happen inside here. We also want to add two variables to this function called \"query\" & \"results\":    \n```javascript\nfunction getMoviemRecomendation(){\n\treturn client.connect().then(() =>{\n\t\tlet query = \"select t.*, r.* \\\n\t\tfrom titles as t join ratings as r on t.imdbratedid = r.titleId\";\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Executing the sql query\");\n\t\tlet res = await client.query(query);\n\t\tresults = [];\n\t}).catch((err)=>{\n\t\tthrow err;\n\t})\n};\n```\nThe first line returns a promise and makes a connection between our application and our database. After making a successful connection, the second part of this function takes place. It creates a variable called \"query\" whose value is equal to what we entered before (\"select...\"). This tells us what data we want returned from the database after being processed through the functions we added next.

Both of these columns contain an integer value representing one of three possible values whereby if both have the same value then they represent a permission granted to all users. If either column does not match any other row within the table then no permission exists. This means that each role requires at least two permissions in order to function correctly. For example, the first row represents a \"Manager\" who may view, edit and delete employees whereas another employee would require read-only access via the second row.\n\nAdditionally there've been some changes made to existing tables such as:\n* `employee`: renamed to `employees`; added columns `supervisor` and `manager`;\n* `location`: removed column `address`;\n* `department`: changed from having two columns named `deptID` and `deptName` respectively to just one column named `deptID`;\n* `job`: renamed to `positions`; added columns `supervises` and `manages`;\n* `category`: renamed to `categories`; added columns `subCategory` and `superCategories`;\n* `character`: renamed to `actors`; added columns `playsRoleOf` and `starsAs`;\n* `movie`: renamed to `films`; added columns `directedBy` and `producedBy`;\n* `genre`: renamed to `styles`; added columns `parentGenre` and `childGenres`;\n* `language`: renamed to `languages`; added columns `countryCode` and `translationLanguage`;\n* `year`: renamed to `releaseDate`; added columns `startYear` and `endYear`;\n* `rating`: renamed to `score`; added columns `type` and `value`;\n* `comment`:"}

They will then have access to login to their accounts where they will see their own profile page which contains information about them such as their favourite genre(s), actors & actresses, etc.\n- Once logged in, user will be able to enter search queries and get recommendations from IMDB.\n    - Search Queries are entered by selecting one or more genres separated by commas e.g., \"Horror\" OR \"SciFi\". User must also select at least one actor's name e.g., \"Brad Pitt\", who appeared in these movies. This feature allows users to narrow down searches according to specific criteria.\n        - If no actor was selected during search process but there were some matching titles found against given set of genres then those films would show up under \"Other Films\". These could include TV shows if applicable too!\n    - Based upon the search inputs provided by user i.e., Genre(s) + Actors Name; DBMS returns list containing recommended movies sorted alphabetically along with details including ratings from various sources available online today. It does not matter whether we find matches within our dataset itself since every record already exists here so no duplicates allowed :) We simply display whatever comes back first whenever possible otherwise fallback option applies allowing us filter out unwanted ones easily enough even though sometimes takes longer than expected due how many times different people type same thing over again repeatedly causing confusion among others trying figure things out quickly instead getting distracted elsewhere thus losing track everything happening around them completely forgetting why started doing anything altogether anyway lol!!!"}

Your first step in building such an algorithm would be to load data into memory using Pandas DataFrame. However, since you are not allowed to use any external libraries like NumPy etc., you must implement all necessary methods yourself. In addition, as part of your assignment, you also want to build a GUI whereby the user inputs his favourite TV series/movie genre and receives back a list of recommended titles accordingly.\n\n## Table Structure & Schema Design\n- `tvshow`: contains information about tv show episodes and seasons\n    - `episode` : episode number within season\n        - `title`, `year`, `seasonNumber`, `airDate`, `rating`, `viewersCount`, `director`, `writter`\n            - `genre`, `description`, `runtimeMins`, `actors`, `characters`\n                - `name`, `birthYr`, `deathYr`, `primaryProfession`, `knownFoTitles`\n                    - `category`, `job`, `character`\n    \n- `movies`: contains information about movies\n    - `releaseYear`, `directors`, `writer`, `actor`, `categories`, `genres`, `rating`, `durationInSeconds`\n        \n## User Interface (GUI):\n* The GUI should include two text boxes called `Genre Selection Box` and `Movie Name Selection box`. Whenever either one of these fields changes value, the corresponding method should be invoked inside the class `Recommender`. This will cause the `recommendedList()` function to update itself with new values every time. For example if I enter a genre (`Action`) then my recommended list will contain Action Movies but when I change my selection to another genre say Romance, then again calling recommending() method will give me romantic comedy movies because they fall under both categories i.e action+romance=action comedy so there could be different combinations possible depending upon what kind"}

If not then use the correct table names instead of using \"title\", \"name\"... as the column names.\n\nYou will first need to get the list of user's favorite titles from his/her preference history so we can find similar titles in our database. To do so we can create an INNER JOIN between `name` & `user_preferences`. We will select those rows where both `primaryName` and `primaryProfession` match any row in the joined table. We will add one more condition here to make sure that at least one of these two matches must exist otherwise no recommendation would be made since there won't be anything left after matching.\n\n\\begin{code}\nSELECT t.* FROM rating r\nINNER JOIN name n ON(r.`category` = n.`job`) AND\n                   ((n.`primaryName` LIKE CONCAT('%',r.`primaryProfession`, '%') OR\n                    n.`primaryProfession` LIKE CONCAT('%',r.`primaryName`, '%')));\n\\end{code}\n\nThis gives us the list of actors who have acted in both the given films.

For example, \"WHERE tconst = x\" would mean \"WHERE the column named tconst has the value equal to x\".\n\n**Hint #2:** In order to get the data from different tables using joins, you will have to specify which table each field belongs to by specifying what table's fields contain them. This can easily be done through aliases! For instance, let us assume we want to select all titles where rating > 7 out of those movies who were released after year 2008 - then our query might look something like this `SELECT * FROM TITLE_RATINGS r INNER JOIN TITLES t ON r.`\n\n**Hint #3:** Remember that every time you execute an INSERT INTO command against a table it creates new rows inside said table but doesn't actually change any existing ones unless specified otherwise via VALUES clause at its beginning; thus don't forget about DELETE statements when deleting records because these won't work properly either way due to how MySQL works internally behind scenes."}

In addition to the user's preference history, you also included other criteria such as the movie genre of Comedy and a minimum rating value greater than or equal to 8.\n\nNow write a function called `getRelevantMovies` that will take into account all of these parameters along with additional ones provided by the user at run time. This means that the function must accept arguments such as the number of recommendations requested (`numberOfSuggestions`) and any additional filters not specified above like year released (`releaseDateFrom`), year released (`releaseDateTo`). It may then use its own algorithm to select a subset of items from the entire set of returned items where each item meets ALL the criteria specified in the function call.\n\nThe returned list of values MUST NOT contain duplicates. If there are no movies meeting the requirements of the request then an empty list should be returned instead.\n\n### Part C - Movie Snippets\nYou have implemented the basic functionality needed to create a movie recommender engine but now it needs some extra features before being deployed. One important feature is to allow users to view snippets from movie descriptions when they hover over movie titles within search results. To do so you could simply add a new column to the `movies` table containing a snippet of text describing the plot. However we want to avoid adding unnecessary data just for visual effect because that would negatively impact performance. Instead we plan to store snippets separately outside of our main database. We will therefore implement a separate table called `movie-descriptions`. Whenever a user hovers over a movie title, we will look up the corresponding description id using the unique identifier stored alongside every movie record in the `movies` table and retrieve information about that particular movie from the external source.\n\nWrite two functions to support the creation of these movie snippets. Firstly define an interface type for storing and retrieving snippets. Secondly define a function called `generateMovieDescription()` which takes one argument, namely the id of a given movie and returns a string representing the associated description. Implement both of these components in PHP."}

Your answer must include all of these points as well as the actual SQL query itself.\n\nYou will use at least one JOIN statement between two tables from different databases. For example: SELECT * FROM tableA INNER JOIN tableB ON condition WHERE condition\n\nAll JOIN statements MUST have an equality condition such as =, <>, <=, >=, IN etc..\n\nThe JOIN condition(s) CANNOT refer to any column named \"id\" or \"primaryKey\". In other words, do not use any primary key/foreign key pairing between tables. This means that if you are using the \"tableA.titleId=tableB.titleId\" join syntax then you cannot get credit for this question. Instead please create another joint condition which does NOT involve id or primarykey.\n\nIf you have more than one join condition then they ALL MUST appear after each other in order. For example: SELECT * FROM tableA LEFT OUTER JOIN tableB RIGHT OUTER JOIN tableC USING(condition) WHERE condition;\n\nDo not write any comments directly within your SQL code. If you want to comment something out put them above or below your code so that the judge knows what's going on. Do not add extra lines before OR after your SQL code either because judges don't see those. Just make sure everything is properly indented inside your code block."}

Your task is to predict which movies an individual user would enjoy given his/her taste as well as some of his favorite titles.\n\nYou are provided with a dataset containing ratings by hundreds of thousands of people who have watched multiple movies. Each row represents one person's rating of each available movie, while each column represents each unique movie he has seen.\n\nAs an example, if someone rates Star Trek highly but not so much Captain America then we assume they probably wouldn\u2019t want to see Thor even though both were made around the same time period because their overall preference doesn't match up very closely across all films.\n\n#### Dataset Description\nThe data set contains two files: `users.csv` & `movies.csv`. Both contain the information necessary to train our model. For simplicity sake let us call these files U and M respectively since they represent User Ratings vs Movies Rated.\n\n**Users File** (`user.csv`:\n| ID | age | gender | occupation |\n| --- | ---- | ------- |---------------|\n| uid1 | 17 | male     | student      |\n| uid2 | 23 | female    | unemployed   |\n| uid3 | 27 | male     | lawyer       |\n...\n\n**Movies file**(`movies.csv`:\n| id        | year         | genre                             | title              |\n| :-------- | :----------  | :------------------------------  | :-------          |\n| mvid1     | 2012         | Action/SciFi                      | Marvel's Iron Man 3 |\n| mvid2     | 1981         |"}

Your task is to create an API in which you will receive user input about their preference of restaurants/hotels etc., and then return recommended places within the given budget. The API should use the Tripadvisor data set provided below. For more information regarding how to build APIs visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIWsjQiF-Xg&list=PLJCzUqZM-VdLN0oOaBKxuD8HhYy0GlkE&index=1\nYou are not required to host your code online but if you do please include the URL at the top of your README file so we can test our submission against yours. Please ensure that your solution works properly before submitting by testing it out through Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/).\n\n#### Dataset:\nDownload link : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/travel-recommendation/tripadvisor.zip\n\nTask Description:\nCreate an API using nodejs to implement trip advisor recommendation algorithm. This api must accept user inputs like hotel name, restaurant names, price range, type of food they want to eat, number of people travelling together etc.. It also needs to give back some suggestions related to these queries."}

What is the purpose of using LIMIT in an SQL statement? Explain why we use LIMIT and what are its benefits over other methods like TOP or ROWS.\n>The `LIMIT` clause limits how many rows from a table will be returned by a SELECT statement. It restricts the number of rows being selected so as not to return all data at once but rather select a specific amount per page. This allows us to efficiently retrieve large datasets while keeping performance high enough where we don\u2019t have too much lag when performing queries against our databases!\n### 6-2. Why would someone choose to run multiple INSERT statements instead of just one big insert into multiple tables?\nBecause it is faster than running a single huge insert operation. If your dataset is very small then there may not even be any difference between these two approaches since both take about same time to execute but if you want something quicker go ahead and do some tests yourself before making assumptions here :)"}

Gans are used to train models that generate data such as images or text. In your assignment, we will use GANs to generate random strings similar to those found in social media posts. Your task is to implement two different types of GAN architectures using Keras, namely the WaveNet architecture proposed by Oord et al. in \"Conditional image generation with wavelets\" and the Wasserstein GAN architecture proposed by Arjovsky et al., in \"Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks\". Both these papers were published in ICML 2017. For each model, please include an implementation that generates samples from both the real distribution and the generated distribution. Also, please include some visualizations/outputs of what these outputs look like when run. Please make sure that you follow all instructions below carefully before submitting.\n\nTask #9 Instructions:\n\n1. Implement the WaveNet architecture proposed by Oord et al.. Use the code provided here.\n\n2. Implement the Wasserstein GAN architecture proposed by Arjovsky et al.. Use the code provided here.\n\n3.

Include at least one JOIN operation between two or more table names.   \n2. Use INNER JOIN as your default join type when selecting from multiple tables.  \n3. Provide an appropriate alias for each table you select from using SELECT statements.  \n4. Your query must return data as expected by the user's input statement and preference history. For example, if the user asked about any movie starring Matthew McConaughey where he plays a doctor, then the returned list of movies should include We Are Marshall (2006), Contact (1997), U-571 (2000). If they asked about all films directed by Martin Scorcese, then the returned list should contain Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), GoodFellas (1990), etc.  \n5. Avoid writing queries which use subqueries within other queries such as: \"SELECT * FROM people p LEFT OUTER JOIN address ad ON p.id = ad.personID\". Instead, write a single query like \"SELECT * FROM people p LEFT JOIN personAddress pa ON p.id=pa.personID\""}

In this part two we will implement a collaborative filtering recommender system whereby given more information about our data sets we are able to predict movies which would appeal to specific individuals. We will use the same dataset as before but now with additional fields such as:\n\n1. popularity_rating [popularityRating, numVotes]\n2. popularity_genre [popularityGenre, numVotes]\n3. popularity_cast [popularityCast, numVotes]\nWe want to create a new table called _user_preferences which contains all of these values along with the existing column name_basics.name_id. This means each row has a unique ID and therefore when selecting rows there is no ambiguity between different users who share the same names.\n\nThe second step involves creating a new table called _user_history which also contains all of the above mentioned values except for the popularity rating field. Now we must join both these tables together into a single table called _users_.\n\nFinally after generating the first list of recommended titles we will add another column to the _movie_titles table called \"similarity\" whose value is calculated by dividing the number of common elements shared across the _user_preferences and _user_history tables. This similarity score is then used to sort the recommendations so they appear at the top of the list.\n\nThe final step requires us to write a SQL statement which joins everything up together and returns the resulting list of recommendations ordered according to the highest similarity score. Your task is to write a SQL statement to achieve this. Please note that you may not execute any queries during testing."}

Your manager has asked you to work on developing a project that will help improve user experience by providing personalized movie suggestions based on past viewing history. To do so, your team needs to collect data from the MovieLens database, which contains information about movies watched over time by each subscriber. This includes the year when the movie was first viewed, how many times it has been rated, whether it\u2019s considered \u201cgood\u201d, etc. Additionally, there is also some metadata associated with these films such as genre and rating score out of five stars given by other people who have seen them before \u2013 all stored within one table called ratings. Finally, another important piece of information available here relates specifically towards each individual viewer themselves including age range (either under/over), gender identity(male/female)...etcetera! Now let us assume we want our algorithm to find similarities between different types of movies but not necessarily those belonging directly together like horror vs romance flicks because they don't match up well enough due lack common characteristics among both categories despite being related somehow through genre classification alone ect...so instead what we seek after are more subtle distinctions made possible via machine learning techniques involving things like clustering algorithms where groups form around shared attributes rather than just having similar features across multiple items being compared against eachother simultaneously thus allowing us greater flexibility while still keeping accuracy levels high enough overall thanks largely down too effective use case scenarios provided earlier today during class discussion period!!!\n\nProject Goal:\n- Generate a SQL query that allows you to retrieve top N similar titles to a particular movie using the following criteria:\n\t* Title similarity = similarity score of two titles\n\t* User"}

When the submit button is clicked, the SQL query generated by you should execute against the database. Once done, show some sample data returned from the execution in HTML table format. You do not have to create a separate view function for each page but rather use one common template file which contains all the views so long as they all share the same URL path prefix. For example if you have two pages with URLs '/users' & '/userinfo': then both these pages will utilize the same template file named index.html. Note: If you wish to store any information about the user such as their history preference lists etc., please make sure to use cookies instead since storing sensitive information like passwords within plaintext files is highly discouraged.\n```python\nfrom flask import *\napp = Flask(__name__)\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef welcome():\n    return \"Welcome to Movie Recommendation System!\"\n@app.route('/users') # User Login Page\ndef loginPage():\n\treturn render_template('login.html')\n\n@app.route('/logout')\ndef logout():\n    session.clear()\n    flash(\"You were logged out successfully!\",'success')\n    return redirect(url_for('index'))\n\n@app.route('/register') # Register Page\ndef registerPage():\n\treturn render_template('registration.html')\n\n@app.route('/signup') # Sign Up Page\ndef signUp():\n\tif request.method == 'POST':\n        print(request.form.get('username').value())\n    \tprint(request.form.get('email').value())\n     \tprint(request.form.get('password').value())\n      \tif len(request.form.get('password')) >= 8:\n            db = get_db()"}

Inheritance allows you to implement functionality defined in parent classes while overriding specific methods as required. Your implementation will include the following components:\n* A method called getMovieSuggestions() which accepts user input and returns an array of recommended titles sorted alphabetically.\n* A method called getAllMovies() which retrieves all titles from the DB table titled \"title_basic\" and returns an ordered list of objects representing each movie in descending order according to year released. This method must also return total number of movies found.\n\n### Hints/Walkthrough\nIn part B we want to use inheritance so our class `MovieRecommendationSystem` extends from `DatabaseInterface`. We do not have access to any data within our base class but we are able to call upon its functions such as `getAllMovies()`.\nWe now define our own class `MovieRecommendationSystem`, extending from `DatabaseInterface`:\n```python\nclass MovieRecommendationSystem(DatabaseInterface):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__(\"imdb\") #super() calls super class constructor first before initializing local attributes\n        \n    @staticmethod\n    def getAllMovies():\n        \"\"\"Returns a list of object containing information about each movie.\"\"\"\n    \tquery = f'''select tb.*, count(*) over () AS TotalCountFromTable ''' + \\\n                '''.from (title_basic tb where tb.isadult=False )'''\n        db_cursor = self._connectToDB()\n        cursor = db_cursor.execute(query)\n        result = []\n        for row in cursor:\n            obj = TitleBasicInfo()\n            obj.title = row[0].lower()\n            obj.year = row[1][-4:] if len(row[1]) > 2 else None\n            \n            obj.genre = ', '.join([str(g).strip('\\'') for g in row[2]])\n            obj.votes = int(row[3])\n            result.append(obj)"}

We also have some optional tasks where you can practice your skills by creating dynamic SQL statements from user inputs.\n\n#### Task #9-A - Inner Join\n\nIn an inner join between two tables, rows are returned if there exists a matching row in both of the joined tables. For example, consider the following SQL statement: `select tb1.*,tb2.* from tbl1 as tb1 left outer join tbl2 as tb2`. In this case, any records in either table which do not exist in the other would return NULL values when retrieved. To see what happens when joining three tables together, let us try something similar but add another condition so that only certain combinations are allowed. For instance, suppose we want to select all actors who appear in movies directed by David Fincher? This could easily be accomplished via an INNER JOIN! First off though, create a new table called \"tbl3\" containing just one column named directorId; then run these commands:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tbl3(directorId INT);\nINSERT INTO tbl3 VALUES (1), (2), (3); -- These IDs correspond respectively with directors David Fincher & Tim Burton...and Quentin Tarantino lolz\n```\nNow insert data into each respective table before running SELECT queries against them individually and jointly:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO tbl1 VALUES ('Johnny Depp','Actor'); INSERT INTO tbl2 VALUES('Tim Burton', 'Director'); INSERT INTO tbl3 VALUES (1,'David Fincher')\n```\nTo retrieve actor names along w/movie titles they starred in during years specified by user input (\"2008\", \"2006\"), use this query below:\n`select cast(years AS VARCHAR(4)) + '-' + substring(cast(title AS varchar(20)),charindex('.',cast(title As Varchar(20)))+1,len(cast(title AS Varchar(20)))) AS Movie, firstname+' '+lastname AS Actor FROM tbl1 LEFT OUTER JOIN tbl2 ON year>=(CAST(YEARS AS INTEGER)-2)+"}

Write an algorithm that will read the contents of the.csv file into a dictionary where each key corresponds to the unique id of each user while values are dictionaries containing all the details about each user such as gender, age range etc... Your program must then execute the SQL query using the data provided by the dictionary created above. For example if there were two users in the csv file named \"John\" and \"Mary\", your dictionary would look something like this below:\n`{'John': {'gender':'male','ageRange':'all ages',...}, 'Mary': {....}}`. Once you have retrieved all the relevant information from the dictionary, pass them along to another function within the same script that generates a list of recommended films suitable for each user given his/her preference history and current likes. For example, if John liked Iron man, he may also enjoy Thor because they both fall under Marvel Movies genre. Hence the suggested film for him could either be Avengers or Captain America depending on what other films he has watched before.

The GUI app should ask the user questions regarding his tastes and interests and display the list of recommended titles after running the SQL query."}

Please read about collaborative filtering and matrix factorization before attempting this assignment.\n\nDesign a more complex recommender system using both item-to-item and user-to-user similarities as described below. Your design will have three main parts:\n\n1) Similarity Matrix Construction\n\n    Create two similarity matrices from the data provided by using either Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient or cosine distance between items/users. These are the two most common ways of computing similarity between objects. For example, if we use Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient then the similarity score would range from [-1; +1], where 1 means \u201cperfect match\u201d while 0 means no relationship at all. If you choose Cosine Distance instead, then there could also be negative values but they would not exceed one (-1).\n\nThe first similarity matrix S[i][j] represents each object i\u2019s degree of similarity to every other object j in the dataset D. So far so good because these numbers represent some kind of measure which tells us whether or not any given pair has ever been seen together before \u2013 hence why we call them \u2018similarities.\u2019 However\u2026 what do these numbers actually mean though?? That depends entirely upon who created those matrices themselves!! Someone might say \u201cHey look man..this guy over here rated A LOT OF THINGS really highly..so maybe he likes everything else too?\u201d whereas another person might think \u201cNo way dude..he hated EVERYTHING except Cats & Hip Hop music!\u201d Both people were right depending on how much weight was placed onto certain criteria when calculating similarities between different pieces of content within our dataset. In short terms though \u2013 they basically just give us clues towards finding out which movies someone might like better than others.\u201d\n\n2) Model Training\n\n    Once we have constructed two similarity matrices from our training set of users and items, train a"}

A personalized recommendation engine helps them discover relevant content which they might enjoy watching. In this project we will build an implementation of one such recommender systems using data from IMDB dataset. We will use MySQL to store our data and Python pandas library to load and cleanse the raw data before training our model.\n\n## Task Description\nThis challenge requires us to create a model that takes into account user ratings alongwith other attributes like genre, cast etc. to make recommendations. This problem is modeled as a multi-class classification problem where each row represents a different set of features and labels. Our goal here would be to predict whether a particular film falls under any given class or not. For example, if someone likes action films then he may also likely like sci fi movies too because both these types have similar characteristics i.e thrill & adventure element involved while story telling process itself differs significantly between two kinds of stories being told through those mediums respectively even though both involve same kinda stuff happening within plot structure but still remains distinctive enough due its unique style so called \u201cgenre\u201d factor plays important role when deciding what type exactly suits your taste better than others does thus giving rise towards more accurate predictions over time once trained properly well done!!!\n\n## Data Sources Used To Train Model\nWe used imdb dataset available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Movie+Review+Dataset. It contains information about various movies released during period starting from year 1980 till present date including all details related to actors, actresses, production companies behind making certain motion pictures etc.. These records were collected manually by volunteer workers who worked hard day night weekends holidays whatever necessary just trying get everything right since no automated way existed back then sadly :( Nowadays however thanks advancements"}

How do you determine which movie to show next? ####\nI use the user's preference history as well as the title_rating table to get the top rated movies from those categories. Then I filter out any of these titles if they are already seen by the user before. Finally, I sort them according to how many times each one has been watched by others. This way, we ensure that our recommendation list will always include some new content along with old favorites.  \nThe process looks like so:\n![alt text](./assets/img-movie-recommendation-system-b.png \"Movie Recommender\")\n> **NOTE**: If there isn\u2019t enough data available then I just take all possible choices at random until finding something suitable. In practice though most people usually have plenty of viewing options even when using small datasets because popular films tend not to change much over time anyway due primarily being about story arcs rather than specific plot points themselves after all so long term trends remain relatively stable regardless what happens elsewhere within society itself during periods between releases etc...\n\n#### 2. What type of algorithm would you suggest implementing to find similar movies? #####\nThere are two main types of algorithms used in recommending systems: collaborative filtering and matrix factorization. Collaborative filtering relies on past interactions between individuals who share common interests while matrix factorization uses information about individual ratings instead of other peoples'. Both approaches work well but differ significantly depending upon whether your goal is accuracy vs efficiency since one requires more processing power whereas another does less computationally intensive computations yet still produces good quality results overall however its drawback lies mainly around scalability issues where large amounts data could become problematic especially given current hardware limitations making performance suffer greatly under such conditions unless proper optimization techniques were applied first hand prior implementation taking place otherwise resulting potentially negative consequences afterwards later down line furthermore once again depending solely upon size constraints imposed upon particular case scenario involved herein questioned above mentioned earlier previously discussed already covered fully explained thoroughly detailed clearly defined precisely laid forth succinctly stated simply put plainly spoken eloquently written concisely presented articulately expressed"}

The goal here is to showcase your understanding of relational databases through solving real-world problems using SQL queries rather than just writing arbitrary queries.\n\n#### Recommendation System Output Format\nIn addition to providing an appropriate SQL query, the user will receive an email containing his/her recommended movies along with ratings and reviews. This email must contain at least two rows per entry which contains one row representing each movie's details such as its IMDB ID number followed by another row consisting of any relevant information about how good these particular films are according to different criteria including but not limited to genre types like romance or action etc..\n\nYou may want to consider adding more detailed feedback if possible since there isn't much room left over after meeting all other needs listed below! For example, maybe include links where people could click directly into watching said videos online instead having them type out long URLs themselves? It would definitely make things easier both sides involved :)\n\n#### Required Data Columns for User Email Notification Message\nThe required data column fields in the table title_recs should match those used previously when generating a report file. These include: `movieID`,`title`,`genre`,`year`,and `rating`. Include any other necessary metadata that might help someone understand what they've been recommended so far without going too deep though - keep things simple yet informative enough!\n\nIf possible please try avoiding duplicate entries within this same list because otherwise we wouldn't know exactly why certain items were being suggested multiple times unless every item was unique already anyway...\n\n**Note** If no records exist then don't bother sending anything else beyond basic info like title & year alone due lack sufficient detail available right now :("}

They must select one of these films as being suitable for them by answering \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d.\nAfter every film has been viewed once, the algorithm updates its knowledge about which films are good/bad for each person using the Bayesian Belief Networks approach. It then generates new suggestions after taking into account both the current state of the network and any new information from the last round.\n\n**Part A - Generated Queries**\nThe queries generated in part **A** will give us all possible combinations between titles and genres available in our dataset so we could use those values when generating more complex queries later on during training phase where there won\u2019t be enough time left over if we were just relying upon basic search terms alone like \u2018comedy romance drama\u2019 etc.. These initial searches should take around ten minutes per run through but depending how many different categories exist within your own personal list(s), yours may vary greatly compared against someone else who might choose something completely opposite such as horror thriller action adventure science fiction fantasy war mystery crime thrillers etc\u2026 This means lotsa options here folks!!\n\n## Part C \u2013 Training Phase\nYou don\u2019t want people coming back saying they didn\u2019t know what genre was actually represented until they watched it because otherwise why would anyone bother watching anything at all?

Now let's look at how to make use of other technologies in our applications such as machine learning libraries like Tensorflow and Pandas. In order to do so we will have to create a new database table called \"Review\" which has these fields:\n- id: Integer autoincrementing PK\n- reviewId: String Unique FK referring back to user preference history\n- text: Text\n- date: Date\nIn addition to creating this table we also need to add another column to the existing \"title\" table called \"rating\". This new field will store each row's corresponding rating from the newly created \"review\" table. For instance if a particular film gets rated by two different people then there would be two rows under its corresponding entry in the \"reviews\" table where one of them might say something along the lines of \"I loved this movie!\" while the second person says \"It sucked!\". These ratings are stored separately because they represent different opinions about what constitutes quality content rather than being just numbers representing some kind of numerical value between 0 through 10 etc.. It makes sense since everyone views things differently but still wants similar kinds of experiences when watching movies online using Netflix/Amazon Prime Video etc... So now let us take care off all those details before moving forward onto actually making predictions using Machine Learning algorithms :)"}

Please follow these instructions carefully before proceeding. Make sure you understand how to use the PyMySQL library from here https://github.com/PyMySQL-developers/PyMySQL.\nYou will also require MySQL workbench installed locally so please make sure you install the software first if not already done so by clicking on the link below. Once installation has been completed open up the MySQL Workbench program and connect to your local instance of MySQL server which was created earlier. Once connected go into the data source explorer tab where there is now a new connection called \u201cIMDb\u201d. This means we have successfully established our connection between MySQL Server and Python. Now create a table within the data source explorer window named \u2018recommendation\u2019 where all user inputs and preference history would be stored. Next right click over the newly created table and select add view then enter the following code exactly into the text box provided and save the script under the name \u2018MovieRecommender\u2019.\n\n```sql\nCREATE VIEW MovieRecommender AS SELECT * FROM Recommended;\n```\nNow in order to retrieve the recommended list simply run the following command from the terminal window:\n`python MovieRecommenders.py`. Note that the path to the file must always include the full location including the.py extension otherwise the execution may fail.

This assignment is broken up into two parts, the first part involves building a data model representing your solution while the second part involves implementing a function which takes inputs and produces outputs according to our requirements below.\n\nData Model: \nWe have provided a JSON file called \"data\" containing information about how many times each movie was watched by different people. Each entry contains three fields: id, personId, count. We expect the number of entries in this dataset not to exceed 2000 but may vary depending on class size. It must also contain at least one record so that we know there are enough records even if no students submit anything! If you run out before then just add another dummy line with zero values everywhere except personIds field where its value should still be equal to some nonzero integer otherwise nothing will happen when running queries against it later on down here :)\n\nFunction Implementation: \nImplement a Python function that accepts an array of integers denoting the ratings given by a particular group/person and returns back all possible recommendations sorted by relevance score (i.e., most relevant at top). For example, suppose I give my friend Aaron who loves action films rated between 1-10 these five movies he might enjoy watching next time they hangout together again after school ends tonight because none were very popular among others yet highly rated themselves respectively : 1=Mission impossible rogue nation, 2 =Fast & furious seven, 3=x men days o f future past, etc... In addition since both myself & him share common interests within certain genre types such as horror / thriller then maybe adding something along those lines would make sense too..\n\nSo far everything looks pretty straightforward right? Well unfortunately things get more complicated once we realize what exactly needs done inside our new program code :-(. That being said let us move forward now onto discussing precisely HOW exactly do we go about accomplishing this seemingly simple task though"}

Your SQL queries must have at least one aggregate function and you may use more than one if necessary. Also include all of your column names in the select clause even though they are not being used.\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM userPreferenceHistory;\n```\nThe above statement will return each row's values in the same order as the rows appear in the table. However, there might exist many different ways to write the same SELECT statement. In other words, there exists multiple equivalent forms of writing a given SELECT statement. For example:\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(rating), AVG(rating), COUNT(*) AS numberOfReviews FROM reviews GROUP BY rating;\n```\nis exactly equal to\n```sql\nSELECT avg(rating), sum(rating), count(*)/count(DISTINCT rating);\n```\nIn addition, note that we do not always want to group by every field in our dataset because sometimes the fields contain redundant information which leads us to waste time computing unnecessary details. Therefore, it would often make sense to add a GROUP BY clause ONLY when absolutely needed. This means that whenever possible, try to avoid adding any GROUP BY clauses.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take these ideas into account while creating the new aggregated table. Firstly, create a new table named \u201cuserRecentPreferences\u201d where we store only those recent movies preferred by the user. Then, execute the below SELECT statements to get desired results:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `userRecentPreferences` (`titleId`, `primaryTitle`, `startYear`, `endYear`) VALUES ('189','Blade Runner 2049','2017-10-06');\nINSERT INTO `userRecentPreferences`(`movieId`, `titleType`, `year`, `monthDay`) VALUES('189','feature film', '2017', '10/06');\nUPDATE `userRecentPreferences` SET `titleType` = 'feature film';\n```\nAfter updating the records, run the following queries to retrieve the list of titles recently watched by the user along with their year ranges.\n```sql\nselect distinct `primaryTitle`,`startYear`,`endYear` from user"}

He has already given you some basic requirements of what he wants in the schema but there are still some details missing about how certain things will work together such as relationships between different types of data. Your first step would be drawing up an ER diagram which includes all entities involved along with any attributes they may contain so far including foreign keys if needed before moving onto normalization steps afterward! To do this well though means having good knowledge around both relational databases themselves while also understanding common design patterns used today when creating them because otherwise everything could fall apart quickly once implemented into production environments later down line...\n## Task Description\nIn this challenge we'll create our own schema for an online bookstore using the concepts learned throughout the course. This time however instead of just generating random numbers each day we want people who come visit us again every weekday morning during breakfast hours until lunchtime (whenever that happens). Our goal here isn\u2019t necessarily profits per se; rather than focusing solely upon selling books ourselves directly through sales channels like Amazon Marketplace etc., we plan on partnering up with other companies whose services complement those offered within these pages too--like shipping providers delivering goods right away via FedEx Express Mail Service\u2122\ufe0for UPS Ground\u00ae\ufe0fetc..\n\nThe table should include three fields: id, authorId, and publisherId. A record represents one book written by an author published under a publishing company. Each row contains information about its respective book. For example, let's say John Smith wrote \"Harry Potter\" for Bloomsbury Publishing Company Ltd.; then we might store something similar-looking across multiple lines inside this same table structure as follows:\n> \"JohnSmith\" | \"BloomPublishingCompanyLtd.\" | \"HarryPotter\"\n\n# Challenge #10 - RDBMS Normal Forms & Denormalized Tables\nNormal forms are important parts of relational database management systems (RDMBS"}

Your program needs to take user inputs and produce the desired outputs of queries. For example, if you were asked by a friend \"How do I find my latitude and longitude?\" then you would say something like \"You have to first ask me where are you located.\" Then the next question will be \"What city am i at?\". In other words, we use two questions to get one answer. This process repeats until there is no more information needed from the user.\n\n**Part One Questions:**\n* What is the purpose of an index key when creating indexes in MySQL?\n\t* Indexes improve performance by providing quicker access to data stored within them than regular table scans because they contain pre-computed values which make searching through them much faster than normal lookups via full table scan methods such as SELECT statements or JOIN operations between different tables containing similar content but not necessarily identical records themselves due solely upon differences found during comparison processes conducted against each individual record type contained inside said indices before returning any finalized results back into memory space allocated towards these particular tasks alone respectively accordingly according pertaining specific requirements requested outlined herein below further details explained clearly enough already provided earlier mentioned above already listed down hereunder right away straight forward simple straightforward uncomplicated easy understandable clear concise precise accurate correct reliable dependable trustworthy sound safe secure stable consistent efficient effective fast timely prompt immediate instantaneous rapid swift quick speedy quickly quickly fast rapidly immediately instantly soon shortly sooner later latter last longer long term time span duration period interval moment second millisecond microsecond nanosecond picosecond femtosecond attomicrosecond yoctosecond zeptosecond etcetera etc alia ad infinitum ect etcetera etc alia ad infinatum et cetera etc etcetera etcetera etcetera ad infinitum etcetceterea etc etcetera etcetceterea etc etcetera etc etcetera etcetcetera etc etcetera etcetcetera etc etcetera etcetcetera etc etcetera etcetcetera etc etcetera etcetcetera etc etcetera etcetcetera etc etcetera etcetcetera etc etcetera etcetcetera etc etcetera etcetceter"}

This assignment requires you to use the MySQL command line tool (mysql).\nIn addition to being able to write simple SQL commands (i.e., SELECT), you must also know how to insert values into new rows using INSERT INTO syntax (see example below). If you do not understand what an INSERT statement does please look up more information about it online before continuing onto writing any code for this project. Please note that there are two ways of doing things here so feel free experiment around until finding something that works well enough for both parts together!\n\nTo run mysql locally follow these steps:\n- Download MySQL Community Server from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/. Make sure you download version 5.7 since that is used throughout this course materials.\n- Unzip downloaded file and open terminal window inside unzipped folder location e.g.: /home/username/Downloads/MySQL-community-server-5.7.*tar*gz*.\n- Type `sudo./configure` at prompt followed by pressing enter key when done configuring environment variables etc.. Next step involves typing `./install`.

This means we are looking at the combination of titles from four different tables. Each row has six fields - tconst, titleType, primaryTitle, originalTitle, isAdult, startYear, endYear, runtimeMinutes, genres, avgrating, numvotes, nconst, primaryname,birthyear,deathyear,primaryprofession,knownfortitle,director,writer,ordering,category,job,character.\nTherefore, your SQL query needs to take into account all these columns while considering the following conditions:\n\n\u2022\tIf any of the column values match between the user\u2019s preference history and the current request then return true; otherwise false. For example, if a user prefers \u2018Dunkirk (2017)\u2019 but currently requests \u2018Jurassic Park (1993)\u2019 then return false as they do not have similar interests. However, if both movies were requested by the same person then return true.\n\u2022\tWhenever possible use LIKE instead of EQUALS to make queries more efficient. If using LIKE then ensure that the value provided after % matches exactly what was stored previously. So for example, if the previous record contained \u2018funny\u2019 and the current request contains \u2018fnny\u2019 then returns true. But if either contain other variations like funny or fanny etc., then returns false.\n\u2022\tOnly look at records where the year range specified in the current request falls within the available years indicated by the title_ratings table. In particular, consider whether there are enough votes for the rating to be considered reliable. As such, if the user requests something rated over 8/10 and the minimum number of required votes is less than 20 then returns false. Otherwise, return true. Note that the same logic applies for the genre field too."}

This time around we have added some additional constraints.\n\nIn addition to user preference history in previous question, the user also provided the genre they like along with a list of movies he/she liked before. We want to make sure that when generating recommended movies, we take into consideration these extra parameters so that we do not recommend bad matches again. As such, add an additional constraint to the above SQL statement to include the given genres. Make sure all conditions are met.\n\nUser Input:\n```text\ngenre: comedy\nmovies I've seen already: Titanic(1997), South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut(1999), Shrek(2001), Napoleon Dynamite(2004), American Pie(1999), Knocked Up(2007), Step Brothers(2008), Superbad(2007), Old School(2003), Clerks II(2006)...\n```\nAdditional Constraints:\n- User preference history must match at least two out of three movies from his/her favorite genres. If there aren\u2019t any then return \u201cNone\u201d.\n- There cannot exist any duplicate entries within the same genre. For example if \u2018Step brothers\u2019 belongs to the Comedy genre and \u2018Superbad\u2019 does too, then both those movies cannot appear together because the first rule requires that each entry needs to come from different genres.\n\n### Task #3 - 2 points\n\nYou have to implement a data structure to store the user inputs in order to perform further analysis. In particular, your goal is to create a class called MovieRecommendationSystem which stores a collection of users. Each user contains information about its gender and age. Your code should accept two files containing multiple lines of text representing the data for all the users and then print a table of the number of male and female users per year of age.\n\nInput file format:  \n`user0.txt`:\n```text\ngender: Male Age: 21\ngender"}

It also assumes that everyone who rates something does so equally often since otherwise things might skew towards older people having seen more new releases recently because younger viewers tend toward newer stuff anyway unless someone else tells me I've been wrong my entire life thus far!\nOption 2: If you want to make sure that no matter what year any given person was born into or died out before getting old enough themselves (which makes sense), then simply add another condition saying \"WHERE YEAR() BETWEEN 1980 - CURRENT DATE + INTERVAL 6 MONTH\".

This will help you understand how models work as well as learn about different algorithms available. Your code must follow the requirements below:\n* Implement the algorithm used by the model (i.e., Collaborative Filtering).\n* Use the pandas library.\n* Use numpy to import the training/testing datasets into numpy arrays.\n* Use sklearn to train the model.\n* Do not use any pre-trained models such as xgboost, neural networks etc.\n* Provide clear instructions on how to run your program.\n\n**Note:** You do NOT have to submit your entire project but rather just demonstrate how each step would look like if implemented correctly.\n\n### Part C - Rating Prediction Model\n\nThis part involves implementing a rating prediction model which predicts whether someone likes or dislikes a particular item after observing ratings given by other people who rated items before them. Your code must follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Make sure all files are saved within one folder named \"PartC\" otherwise they won't get evaluated properly!\n2. Use Tensorflow Lite as your machine learning framework since we want our solution running quickly across multiple devices including mobile phones where GPU acceleration isn't always possible due to power constraints so having something lightweight helps us achieve better performance overall compared with alternatives such as PyTorch & Scikit Learn which require more resources than what most developers have access too at present time anyway :).

Now we want to extend our database by adding two more tables as well as add another column into one of them. Your new table structure will look like so:\n\n1. title_reviews [tconst, treviewId, userReviewID, rating, reviewBody, titleID]\n2. title_trailers [ttrailerId, trailerLink, videoURL, thumbnailImage]\n3. title_actors [tactorId, actorFirstName, actorLastname, characterRole]\n4. title_genres [tgenreId, genreName, movieGenre]\n\nWe now have four different types of data stored inside these three tables. The first type are reviews from people who watched a particular movie. Each row contains an ID of both reviewer as well as the movie itself. Next comes information about actors involved in making each movie possible such as their names and roles they played during filming. Thirdly, there's info regarding various genres used while creating certain films. Last but not least, finally we got something called \"Trailers\" where viewers could see what kinda stuff was coming next before deciding whether or not watch said movie later down line!\n\nTo complete this part successfully; however requires some additional work done outside classroom environment because unlike last time around here we don\u2019t just wanna get back same old results again instead we also wish know exactly how many times did every specific person rate any particular flick too? For example if someone liked Black Panther then perhaps he/she rated other Marvel related productions higher than usual meaning those kinds would probably show up near top positions when being filtered through algorithm running behind scenes here\u2026..\n\nNow let me ask u another question : How do I join my tables together using JOIN statement? Remember guys- this ain't no easy feat!! But atleast try ur best ;) Good luck everyone!!!\n\n### Question #7 - Movie Recommender System - Final Project\n\nThe final project for this course consists of completing three tasks. Task 1 involves designing a relational model representing the IMDB dataset along with its associated attributes"}

CAPM - Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM): \nYou are given an investment portfolio consisting of two assets A and B where asset A has expected return rA = 8%, variance sigmaAA^2= 9%, while asset B has expected return rB = 11%, variance sigmaBB^2 = 12%. Calculate beta for both assets using your knowledge from previous classes. Explain how you calculated them in detail.\n\nAssets A and B have different variances so they cannot be combined into one portfolio since there would not be any diversification between these assets which leads us down the path towards computing each individual asset's beta separately by finding out its covariance matrix first before taking its inverse transpose and then dividing it over all other assets within our entire portfolio; if we were able somehow manage another way around this problem though maybe through some sort algorithmic technique such as linear programming etc., I don\u2019t know what else could possibly work here! But let me explain why exactly those methods won\u2019t do either because otherwise everything seems fine until now...\n\nWe have been given information about two assets: A and B but unfortunately neither one knows anything about themselves except perhaps whether they like cats more than dogs(?) Or vice versa..? Well okay fine whatever works best suits everyone involved anyway just make sure not too many people get hurt along the process cause nobody wants bloodshed especially when dealing with finances!!\n\nIf we assume that there exists no correlation among returns across time periods, then calculating betas becomes trivial since simply plugging numbers into formulas will give us answers right away without much trouble at all!!! However even under these assumptions things still aren\u2019t perfect yet because sometimes correlated movements occur causing problems later down line whenever trying implement new strategies involving risk management techniques due mostly lack understanding current situation fully well enough yet\u2026but luckily help comes soon afterward thanks goodness because finally someone realizes something important needs done immediately before disaster strikes again!.\n\n## 7.

In this challenge we are going to extend that dataset by adding more information about how much they enjoyed these films.\n\nYou will again use the IMDb API but this time you'll be making two separate calls. One call will return all films under a certain genre, while another call returns ratings for those films.\n\nFirstly make sure you have installed nodejs and npm if not then follow the instructions below\n```sh\nnpm install -g nodemon # This command runs Node automatically when you change files\nnpm init # Create a package file so that you can run tests against them later\ncd./challenge-b/movie-recommendation && npm i\n```\nThen clone down the github repo into the same directory using `git clone https://github.com/Udacity/MovieRecommenderChallenge`\nNow open up terminal at the root level where there should now be three folders: `./challenge-a`,`./challenge-b`and `./challenge-c`\nMake changes to both parts of the codebase inside the `./challenge-b/` folder and save them before running any tests. Testing was added in order to ensure that every part of our solution works together correctly, including making appropriate requests to external APIs such as IMDB.\nWhen testing make sure to use a valid JSON response file from the imdb api that has data for both genres and ratings!\n\n### Part C - Prediction\n\nThis final part involves generating predictions for new movies within a specific genre. To do this you will take the most popular films from the last year, along with their corresponding ratings, and calculate what other movies would also receive similar scores. Then rank the list according to predicted score.\n\nAgain, first thing to do is check out the requirements document above to see exactly what needs doing here. Make sure to read over the comments throughout the code base too, especially near the top of each function. These notes contain some helpful hints that may help you complete this section.\n\nWe encourage you to implement this prediction functionality yourself rather than copying someone else\u2019s answer verbatim.

This project will teach you how to build your own generic recommender system by implementing collaborative filtering methods such as KNN & PCA onto existing data sets found on Kaggle Datasets website under \u201cMovies\u201d tab!\n\nIn this assignment, we\u2019ll explore some basic concepts related to Machine Learning through code implementation so feel free not just read but also try out things yourself if possible :)\n\n#### Project Goal : Create a recommender system which predicts ratings given by other people who ordered similar dishes before them (either positive/negative). Your model must be able to handle missing values (i.e., when there isn\u2019t enough information available yet) and show accuracy improvement compared against baseline models (like Naive Bayesian classifier). We encourage students not only focus solely on improving performance metrics alone since having fun while coding always matters too ;) Let us know how well did everything go after finishing this assignment by leaving feedback below!\n\n### Data Description \nWe use a dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) called `restaurants` which contains around 19 million entries representing reviews written by people across United States between years 2007-2013 (with each review containing rating value ranging from 1-5 stars along with textual description). Our goal here would then become predicting whether someone gave high score (`>3`) or low one (`<2`). Note though that no matter what approach chosen during development process \u2013 it still needs validation step afterwards so please take into account all necessary steps required prior submitting final solution :) \n\n\n### Problem Statement"}

Each diagram must have at least two entities, relationships between those entities as well as attributes within each entity.\nIn addition to creating an Entity Relation Diagram (ERD), students will also be required to write pseudocode which describes what happens when user inputs certain values into your application's interface. Students should use their knowledge about programming concepts such as loops while writing these pieces! Finally they should test out their solution by running some queries against MySQL Database Server itself so they know exactly where things went wrong if something doesn't work correctly during execution time..\nThis assignment has been designed specifically because many people struggle with understanding complex topics like relational databases without seeing them applied practically firsthand before diving deep down into theory later on after learning everything else needed already along side other essential components involved here too...\n#### User Input\nWrite a brief description of the scenario in English language, describing who uses your app and why would he/she want to do so.\n\n### Problem Set #7 - Graph Theory & Algorithms\n#### Task Overview\nGraph Theory & Algorithms Problem Set is one of three courses offered by Stanford University's CS 239 class taught by Professors Dana Nau and Mark Nelson. This course focuses primarily on algorithms for solving graphical problems such as finding shortest paths through networks or generating all possible permutations from given sets etc., but it does cover more general topics related mainly around linear algebra including matrices and vectors among others too! In order words--anything having anything remotely connected could potentially fit under its umbrella term \"graph theory\" since most math classes involve graphs somehow whether intentionally planned ahead or not ;) So let us get started then shall we???\n**Note:** Please remember that while taking any online quiz tests provided below always ensure accuracy over speed whenever answering questions posed towards yourself due respectful consideration towards fellow peers attempting similar exams simultaneously alongside yours self included!!"}

Your goal will be to build an effective movie recommender system by implementing collaborative filtering technique over user ratings data from IMDB dataset. This will involve building a model which predicts how much a new user would like each possible rating given his/her personal taste as well as previous interactions with similar movies according to their respective ratings. In other words, your algorithm must have some knowledge about what kind of films are popular among people who rated positively certain ones beforehand so they could suggest those same types when asked whether someone else likes them too! To achieve this objective we use two different methods called \"regression\" and \"classification\". Regression models try estimate values instead of predictions while classification tries classify things into categories such us positive vs negative reviews etc...\n\nThe first method involves creating two lists containing all possible combinations between every pair within our dataset where both sides share at least one element belonging either group A or B respectively but not necessarily together since there might exist cases where no common ground exists between these sets e g if one side contains only actors whereas another has nothing related except maybe director then no match would occur here even though both groups contain members from Hollywood industry because none belong exactly alike therefore making impossible any sort comparison between them due lack information needed thus resulting failure attempt create relationship between said entities via mathematical formulae expressed through formulas involving variables representing specific characteristics shared between items included inside corresponding set(s). We call this process \"combining datasets\" since after doing so each item belongs exclusively one particular subset rather than being part multiple groups simultaneously allowing efficient processing time required perform calculations effectively fast enough allow real-time decision making during execution phase program itself runs smoothly without hindrance caused large number simultaneous operations performed concurrently against massive amounts raw data stored inside memory buffer provided hardware platform used execute computations requested user interface application running client side browser window opened web page loaded internet connection established communication channel initiated request send request received response sent back server hosting website accessed remotely computer network connected local area network LAN connecting devices wired wirelessly wireless internet service providers ISP"}

The purpose of your design is to allow the user to register using one form by entering all the necessary information at once rather than having them fill out multiple forms.\n\nWhen creating a login page, make sure there are no default values set for fields like First Name, Last Name etc. If the user does not enter anything into these fields then they won\u2019t get saved anywhere within our application which means we would never know who those people were if someone tried logging into another account under different credentials later down the line! We want everything submitted during signup time because otherwise nothing happens when trying again after failing first attempt due lacking enough info needed beforehand--this includes usernames too since those aren't required either unless specified differently somewhere else along journey through process itself.\u201d\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nSolution approach:\nThis problem was solved using SQL queries and stored procedures.\n\n### Output Example\n![](https://github.com/NishantMahajan23/My-Portfolio/blob/master/images/outputExample.png)"}

We will refer to this implementation as \u201cMovie Recommender\u201d throughout this document. In order to do so, please follow these steps:\n1. Implement the SQL query generated in part I into MySQL database. Please note that if you have not already done so, you must first create all necessary databases within AWS before implementing the queries. To do so, open up a new terminal window from inside the class folder where the files are located and run the commands below after creating each respective database within AWS:\n    ```sql\n     CREATE DATABASE `movie_recs`;\n    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `movie_rec`.* TO 'user@localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<your password>';\n    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n    ```\n   This command creates a \u2018movie_recs\u2019 database named \u2018Movie Reccomenders\u2019 which allows us access to the data contained therein through our user account credentials. Once this has been completed, you may then proceed to write the SQL query given by the instructor above. Afterwards, close out any remaining terminal windows opened during the creation process.\n2. Next, you will need to configure the \u2018movie_recs\u2019 database to allow access via phpMyAdmin. If you did not install phpMyAdmin when installing XAMPP earlier, simply download and install it again now. Once installed, launch phpMyAdmin from its shortcut underneath the \u2018XAMPP/phpmyadmin\u2019 directory. Once launched, select the option labeled \u2018Server\u2019 at the top right corner of the screen followed by selecting the \u2018+\u2019 icon next to the dropdown menu. From here, enter the IP address assigned to your instance and leave port number blank since we are accessing this through localhost instead of remotely over the internet. Click \u2018Go!\u2019 once complete. Now navigate to the database containing your movie records titled \u2018movierecs.\u2019 At the very bottom left hand side of the screen, click on the tab labeled \u2018Structure,\u2019 and scroll down until you locate the table titled"}

Your goal is to improve upon your company\u2019s current model which uses a logistic regression algorithm. To accomplish this, you must use both the training dataset and test datasets provided in order to train a new machine learning classifier with better performance than what was previously achieved through linear models alone.\n\nIn addition to improving accuracy rates overall across all films within each genre/sub-genre group when compared against other similar titles; however also increase precision while decreasing recall at least slightly but not more so than previous iterations did either before adding any additional features into consideration here too!\n\nTo do this successfully requires building out some basic knowledge about how data scientists approach problems like these from scratch \u2013 starting off simple enough until they get really complex over time since there are many different types available depending on what kind(s) we want our solution set up around firstly\u2026then moving onto things such as feature engineering afterward once everything else has been taken care off already etcetera...\n\n#### Data Setup\nThis assignment consists of two parts. In part I, you will create a table called \u201cmovies\u201d containing information about movies. This includes information related to actors who starred in those films (such as name), director names, year released, rating given by viewers (out of five stars possible). Part II involves writing queries that select rows matching certain criteria from the newly created table.\n\nPart One: Create Table \"Movies\"\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE `movies` (\n\t`movieId` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n\t`name` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'Movie Title',\n\t`yearReleased` bigint UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 COMMENT 'Year Released',\n    `rating` tinyint unsigned NOT"}

In order to do so you must first learn about JSON objects in JavaScript as well as HTTP requests which are used by RESTful APIs. This will allow you to build upon these skills later when building more advanced applications. Your task is to implement a simple chat application that allows two people connected over an internet connection to send messages back-and forth between each other. To accomplish this, you must use HTTP POST requests along with data sent through form fields within HTML pages accessed via URLs such as http://localhost/chat?name=Bob&message=Hello%2C+World!.\nYou may choose any language or framework but we strongly encourage using TypeScript since it provides some additional features like static typing support and compiler errors before running code which makes debugging much easier than traditional languages like C++ where bugs could go unnoticed until after deployment time has passed because they weren\u2019t caught during development stages due lack thereof at all times throughout entire project lifecycle cycles from beginning till end every single day without fail no matter what happens next up ahead down below right here now today tomorrow yesterday last week month year decade century millennia epoch geologic era age period moment second nanosecond picosecond femtosecond microsecond millisecond centisecond milliampere ampere volt watt joule calorie kilocalories kilojoules megajoules gigajoules terrajoules exajoules zettjoules yottajoules etcetera ad infinitum eternally forever everlasting always never not occasionally sometimes rarely often frequently constantly continuously intermittently irregularly discontinuous erratic randomized periodic cyclical deterministic stochastic chaotic nonlinear linear constant proportional inverse reciprocal exponential logarithmic trigonometric sinusoidal cosine tangent cotangent secant cosecant versin hyperbolic arcsinh arcctanh arccosh arccotanh arccsch arccsc hyperbolic arsin hyperbolic acos hyperbolic atan hyperbolic tanh hyperbolic sech hyperbolic coth hyperbolic sechh hyperbolic cotsh hyperbolic sch hyperbol"}

The format is similar to what we saw earlier but with more information about each film. This time around though, since there are thousands of films instead of just hundreds, we\u2019ll need to break up our dataset into smaller chunks. To accomplish this goal, we first read the entire list of movies and save it into memory using the.load() method of pandas DataFrame objects. Then, once everything has been loaded into memory, we split our dataframe into pieces according to size.

This web application must then process the input by retrieving data from the MySQL server using Python's mysql package, storing this information in a dictionary object, processing the dictionary values into strings, generating the output as JSON format, and sending back the JSON string via a HTTP response header. Your goal is to design a basic user interface consisting of two text fields accepting inputs and one button submitting them. Whenever a request comes in, check if there are any records stored in the table already; otherwise insert new record.\n\nThe table has the following columns:\n1. id - auto incremented ID column used for unique identification of each entry\n2. firstname - First Name field for User Input\n3. lastname - Last Name field for User Input\n4. emailaddress - Email Address Field for User Input\n5. password - Password field for User Input\nYou also need to add another column called \"date\" which stores the date when a particular record was created. Use UNIX timestamp for date time. Once all these entries are made available, run a script to retrieve every row from this table, store its value in a variable named dict[], and return those values as a list of dictionaries inside a JSON file.\n\n**Note :** You do not need to implement the functionality to remove/delete rows from this table but you may include it if required!"}

Firstly, I excluded any adult content from my search by using the condition `isAdult=false` then I got all titles where type was not null i.e. not empty string. Next step was getting data about these titles - how long they were, what year they came out etc. Finally I joined other tables such as crew, principals, ratings and names."}

Note that there will always be 3 names returned regardless if any similarity exists between them. For example, if the first two inputs were \"History\" and [\"Bill Gates\", \"Jeff Bezos\"], then our application would still return the third recommended item even though no history-related items exist among Bill Gates & Jeff Bezos!

Your task is to use these samples as references when writing your code. Specifically, your goal is to transform each row into two new rows by adding a column called \"rating\" which contains the user rating value associated with each row. In addition, if the rating field does not exist yet then set its value to zero. For example, suppose we are given the following sample data:\n| Movie Title | Average Rating   | Num Voters     | Year    | Genre      |\n|-------------|------------------|---------------|---------|----------|\n| Jumanji      | Not Available     | Not available | 1995    | Comedy    |\n| Star Wars     | 8                | 6             | 1977    | Action & Adventure         |\n| Harry Potter  | 8               | 6            | 2001    | Fantasy                       |\n\nThen after running our transformation process, the resulting dataset would look like below:\n| Movie Title          | User Ratings        | Num Voters     | Year     | Genre           |\n|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|---------|--------------------|\n| Jumanji              | NaN                  | NaN           | 1995    | Comedy            |\n| Star Wars             | 8                   | 6             | 1977    | Action & Adventure |\n| Harry Potter          | 8                   | 6             | 2001    | Fantasy            |\nThe final step of the project is to create a visualization of the ratings distribution within your transformed dataset. Use any tool(s) such as Tableau Public or Data Studio to produce a bar chart representing the top ten most popular movies along with corresponding ratings information. You must include at least one filter on the x axis so that viewers may select different types of movies to see how they compare against other films.\n\n### Part Three - 8/10/2021\nYou are"}

In order to do so you must first perform some basic analysis before creating your application.\nThe citation dataset has two tables:\n* authors contains information about individual researchers including their names, affiliation, publications etc.;\n* articles describes each article published by these researchers along with the number of times they have been cited since publication.\nEach row in table articles corresponds to one paper written by author(s).\nIn addition there are four additional fields which allow us to record how many times any given author was mentioned within another author\u2019s paper, i.e.: co-authorship counts (\u2018coauthors\u2019), how often someone else used them as reference material (\u2018refused\u2019), if we were able to find references where someone had directly quoted/claimed ownership over something belonging to our subject matter expert (\u2018quote\u2019); lastly whether we could identify anyone who might hold copyright rights relating specifically back towards our source itself (\u2018copyrighted\u2019).\n\nCreate a new class called Author that stores information about an author such as his full name and email address. Create another class called Article that holds details about every article ever written by an author. Finally add three methods into both classes that return true when either coauthors(), refused()or quote()are met respectively.\n\nUse these classes to write code that prints out a list of all possible combinations of authors and articles from the database. For example, suppose there are 7 authors A through G and 3 articles P, Q & R then there would exist 14 different ways of selecting 3 distinct pairs from among those options \u2013 namely AAQ, ABP,ACG...etc., up until ZGZ! These combinations represent potential collaborative opportunities between academicians working together on specific projects but also serve as useful metrics against which other similar ones may later compare themselves too e.g., \u201cwe worked well together once already!\u201d\n\nWrite code that allows you to search for matching author profiles across multiple databases at once rather than having just one per"}

For example if someone votes twice then there will always be at least 1 vote where they didn't show up again after voting once already so let me explain why... If somebody votes during election day then he gets counted towards total number while others get added onto final tally too because everyone else had casted ballots before him did even though those people hadn't shown up yet either way still counts towards overall count right? Now imagine situation when everybody goes home immediately after casting ballot whether successful attempt made earlier failed miserably or not; well guess what happens next time around now wouldn't matter anymore unless maybe someone comes back later tries another time round again anyway doesn't really change anything does it? So basically saying nothing matters except perhaps making sure enough effort was put into trying hard enough until finally succeeding eventually ending up happy enough knowing whatever outcome happened wasn't entirely due solely upon luck alone instead skillful execution played big role throughout entire process leading ultimately towards desired goal achieved successfully without any issues encountered along route taken thus far!"}

This would return all records from both of my tables. However I realised after some research that this isn't what we are supposed to do here as there will not be any filtering going on in our code which means every record from each table will get returned. Instead we want to filter out the data beforehand using where clauses.\n\nI then tried writing another query with two separate joins but again no luck. It seemed that one way to solve this problem could be by using a subquery. But unfortunately because I am new to programming and don't understand how these work yet, I couldn't figure them out either.\n\nAfter looking at other people's solutions they were similar to mine except instead of having multiple different join statements they had just one big statement containing many conditions. For example if someone said something along the lines of \"IF this condition applies THEN execute the next part\". So I figured I needed to make sure I knew exactly what goes into these kind of statements otherwise I wouldn't know when to apply the correct ones.\n\nSo now I'm trying to learn about conditions and how they affect things inside SQL queries such as joins etc.. And hopefully once I have understood everything properly enough I might finally find success!"}

Exercise 2 - Movie Recommendation System Part II\n\nNow that we have an idea of how to make our own movie recommender systems in part one, let\u2019s take things up another notch by implementing a more complex model using neural networks.\n\nIn addition to your existing data set from exercise number five above, add two new fields to each table as follows:\n* `genre` : A list of strings containing all possible genre values. For example, `[\u2018Action\u2019,\u2019Comedy\u2019,\u2019Drama\u2019]`\n* `rating`: An integer value between zero and four indicating whether the user liked or disliked the movie, where higher ratings indicate liking the film.\n\nYou will now use these additional features to train your machine learning algorithm which must be able to predict what other films a given user would like based solely upon their rating history. Your final product should look something similar to this:\n![alt text](https://github.com/russellmitchell/MachineLearningProject/blob/master/_posts/images/neuralnet.png \"Neural Network\")\n\n#### Solution\nThe solution can be found here https://github.com/russellmitchell/MachineLearningProject/tree/master/MLP_Exercises"}

In this part, you are going to implement an Extract Transform Load process (ETL). This means that you have to read data from a.csv file provided by us which contains all the information required to run the SQL query generated during part A above. Once you successfully load the files into the database, you will then verify whether the data loaded correctly by running the same SQL queries again against the newly populated table(s), if there was no error then you pass this step. If not, make sure that you fix the issue before moving onto the next step.\n\n#### Step 1 : Read the.CSV File ####\n\nYou'll first need to know how many records there are in each column so you can determine what type of datatype to store them under when loading these values into the database. To do this, open up one of those individual columns within Excel/Google Sheets and copy down every value until they repeat themselves once more at either end of whatever range has been copied over thus far; now divide both ends together by two since halfway through copying everything across twice would mean having already reached another ending point wherein nothing else could possibly exist beyond itself! Afterwards go back into whichever program(s) you chose earlier today & paste everything right away before proceeding further along towards actually inserting anything actualy useful inside here...\n\n#### Step 2 : Import the.CSV File into the Database Table ####\n\nOnce imported, check if any rows failed to import properly due to invalid data types like integers instead being stored as strings instead? If yes then try fixing it manually but keep track otherwise things might get messed up later on when trying out different options available depending upon situation presented e.g.: if one particular field contains values containing special character set then change its datatype accordingly according specific requirements mentioned previously while still ensuring compatibility between databases involved throughout whole procedure!\n\n#### Step 3 : Verify if Loading Successful :: Run Same"}

This time around we want our query to also take into consideration if the recommended films are already in our viewing list so that we don't watch them again unless they were not watched before.\n\nHere is how things look like after adding an additional column called \"viewed\" which indicates whether we have seen/watched each film previously.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67352731/151046977-cdfdbfa9-e4fc-4ad6-bafe-16afcfebfbcd.png)\n\nThis means that now when we run the same query but instead of selecting titles whose average rating is higher than all previous selections, we select those whose average rating is lower than any other selection.

The database has two additional tables:\n\n1. movies_genre [mgconst, genre, count]\n   This table contains data about which movies have been given certain ratings by people in general. The column \"count\" shows how many times each rating was assigned to any particular film. For example, if you find an entry of 67 for the value 8/10, then there are 67 films whose average user rating is exactly equal to 8 out of 10 stars.\n   \n   ```sql\n       SELECT mg.* from MoviesGenre as MG INNER JOIN Titles T ON MG.movieId=T.titleID where Rating >= 5 order by COUNT(*) desc limit 10;\n   ```\n     \n    2. popularity_by_year[pyear, pmonth, yearlyPopularity]\n         This table tracks month-to-date popularity of all movies released during some specific period (e.g., January 2017). It does not include data about what other people like watching but instead just gives the number of views per day for every movie ever made since 1900.\n        The most recent entries will always appear at top because they were added last while older ones may get pushed down over time due to increased competition among new releases.\n          To retrieve information from this table use `popularity_by_year` alias when selecting rows using joins etc...\n          \n            ```sql\n              select py.* from PopularityByYear as PY inner join TitleTitles t on pyea = t.year;\n             ```"}

To get full credit make sure your solution meets all of the requirements in Part A, B & C below.\nPart A - Data Modeling Diagram:\nDraw two data model diagrams representing how the information from the User Profile table and Movie Review Table would relate to one another. Make sure both models represent the same structure as shown in the example below. Each diagram must include at least four entities and relationships between them using appropriate symbols. Each entity should also contain at least five attributes including an ID attribute, which identifies the record uniquely within its respective entity.\n\nPart B \u2013 Implementation Details:\nExplain how you implemented the algorithms and methods discussed throughout the course material into your final project. Include the details of your implementation such as pseudocode descriptions and any specific programming language features used along with justification for why they were chosen over other options. Your explanation should not exceed more than half of the word count requirement given above.\nYou may want to use the following guidelines when writing up your submission file:\n\u2022 Use bulleted lists where possible instead of paragraphs if there is no new line required after every item listed out e g Listed below are steps taken by our algorithm during execution.\n\u2022 Do not write sentences starting off with \u201cThe\u201d,\u201cIn order to\u201d, etc., unless absolutely necessary since these words do not add value towards explaining what was done by your program/algorithm but rather act like filler content taking away valuable space from describing what exactly happened inside your codebase i e Algorithm takes input values from user then performs certain actions based upon those inputs before returning back desired output.

In order to do so, you must first understand how to train and evaluate models in Pytorch Lighting. This guide assumes some familiarity with Pytorch Lightening as well as basic Python programming concepts. If you are new to either then we strongly suggest reviewing these materials before attempting any exercises below.\n\n#### Train Model\n\nThe goal here is to train our model to predict user ratings given a list of movies they have seen previously. We'll use the `train()` method which takes three arguments:\n* `epochs`: number of training epochs\n* `batch_size` : size of each mini-batch during training\n* `callbacks` : list of callback functions to run at different points during training\n\nLet's take a look at one example:\n\n```python\ntrainer = Trainer(max_epochs=5,\n                   batch_size=16,\n                   gpus=(torch.cuda.current_device()))\nmodel = BiLSTMModel() # Create bi-directional LSTM model\ntrainer.fit({\"input\": {\"movielens\", \"user\"}, \"target\": [\"movie\"]}, model)\n```\n\nHere we pass the model to fit(), along with a dictionary mapping the inputs (`{\"input\":...}`), outputs (`[\"movie\"]`), and loss function (`loss`).\n\nWe also include a second argument called `callbacks`, where we specify which callback methods to call while training. A callback object is just another python class/function that has been registered by passing its `__init__` method into `add_callback()`. Here's what a simple callback might look like:\n\n```python\nclass MyCallback():\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._best_valid_acc = None\n        \n    def on_validation_step(self, trainer, pl_module):\n        if not self._"}

In addition, write a script that reads data from CSV files stored inside S3 buckets and writes the same back to another location like RDS or Redshift. \n\n#### Solution\nThis question was asked at the interview level itself. They wanted me to create an ETL pipeline between two different services/products offered by AWS i.e., SQS(Simple Queue Service)/Amazon Kinesis vs EC2 Instance/Redshift.\nThe challenge here was to find out how these services are connected and what's the best way to connect them together so that I could build my own solution around them. It took some time before I realized that there were many ways through which we could achieve our goal but one thing remained constant throughout all those methods; they involved creating scripts either manually via shell commands or programmatically via python etc..\nOnce done with setting up everything properly then writing actual queries became pretty easy since most people tend not knowing much about sql syntax unless they happen upon something specific enough where even if someone doesn't know anything else except basic concepts such us SELECT statements etc...they still might get stuck somewhere along lines because sometimes things just don't work right away due certain issues related with permissions settings etc....so always keep yourself updated regarding latest changes made within respective products mentioned above especially when dealing large amounts data coming from multiple sources simultaneously.\"\n\n### Question #8\nGiven a set of movies names, list down the top 10 popular movies over last five years.\n\nSolution\nI had written the below code. This has been tested against the dataset provided by the interviewer during the interview round. The test cases have been passed successfully.\n```python\ndef top_movies():\n    '''\n        Given a set of movies names, list down the top 10 popular movies over last five years.\n    \n        \u2753\ud83e\udd14 How would you do?\n     \n    \u2611\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf How did you"}

It works by breaking down complex tasks into smaller ones called Map-reduce jobs then scheduling them across multiple servers simultaneously allowing us get better performance than other languages do when running similar queries over larger datasets because there's no limit on how much memory each node has available at once unlike some others where every machine needs its own space allocated before anything else starts happening inside those machines themselves\n\n#### Task\n\nImplement your solution to part b above but instead you will use hivql syntax rather than standard sql syntax. You must also make sure all parts of the query have been covered correctly including filtering out irrelevant movies from being recommended e.g if user wants romantic comedy type films then he/she wouldnt want action adventure types shown up here even though these might match criteria otherwise set forth by user request i.e. theyre both rated well enough accordingto whats askedforetc\u2026\n\n**Note :** This question doesnotrequireyou tousehivesqlinpartaorpartb;howeverifyouchoose touse itthen please ensurethatallpartsareexecutedcorrectlywithnoerrorsandcompleteoutputisprovidedaswellasdocumentationexplaininganycomplexitiesusedduringdevelopmentofsolution\n\n### Part C \u2013 Movie Recommender System using Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nIn this project, we\u2019ll implement a recommender system that uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether or not someone likes certain kinds of movies.
